    <p class="p-txt">A contract for difference, or ‘CFD’, is an over-the-counter leveraged trading product,
        functioning through what’s known as a derivative—an instrument essentially mirroring price movement
        of an underlying market, or underlying asset. CFD products offer market participants the ability to
        trade a broad range of asset classes, including foreign exchange (Forex), individual stocks
        (equities), indices, commodities and cryptocurrencies. </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Formed through ‘contracts’ between a buyer and seller, the CFD market allows traders and investors
        to speculate on the future course of a market’s price movements without taking ownership of the
        underlying asset. By way of an example, a trader who believes the price of gold will advance can
        trade a commodity CFD based on the underlying price of gold (ticker: XAU/USD) without purchasing the
        underlying commodity. Similarly, an investor wishing to invest in Apple (ticker: AAPL) can purchase
        (or sell) a share CFD based on the underlying stock price (share price) of Apple.
    </p>
    <p>
        CFD hedging also remains a popular cost-effective strategy to offset potential losses.

    <p class="h-txt-cus">CFD Trading Terms</p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        <b>&bull; Going Long</b>
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt"> Based on analysis, if a trader believes the price of a financial instrument will rise,
        a CFD trader can execute a ‘buy position’. In trading parlance, this refers to a ‘long position’ in
        which the trader gains in the event of a rise in price.</p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        <b>&bull; Going Short</b>
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt"> If a trader anticipates the price of a market may fall, selling the respective CFD
        instrument is an option, a short position which can result in a gain following a sell-off.</p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        <b>&bull; Opening and Closing Price </b>
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt"> The opening price is the ‘execution price’ filled by a CFD provider. Traders often
        refer to this value as an ‘entry price’. The closing price is a ‘liquidation price’, a price value
        in which a trader elects to close an active CFD position. </p>
    <p class="p-txt"> CFDs work by <span style="text-decoration:underline;">exchanging</span> the <span
            style="text-decoration:underline;">difference</span> in value between the opening and closing
        price of a CFD position.</p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        <b>&bull; Protective Stop-Loss Level </b>
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt"> For many CFD traders, the use of s protective stop-loss order is essential risk
        management, in place to reduce further loss beyond a pre-determined risk tolerance.</p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        <b>&bull; Leverage and Margin </b>
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt"> Leverage and margin are related concepts.</p>
    <p class="p-txt"> Leverage represents the capacity to increase exposure to amounts larger than available
        equity in a trading account. Greater returns are, therefore, possible when employing leverage,
        though it’s important to note that increased risk of larger losses are also present. Each CFD broker
        has a maximum allowable leverage: 50:1, 100:1 and 500:1, for example. A 100 USD account using 100:1
        leverage means for every 1 USD in a trading account, the trader effectively has access to 100 USD.
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt"> Traders and investors employ margin to generate leverage. Higher leverage equals lower
        initial margin requirement and lower leverage equals higher initial margin requirement. In the case
        of Forex, the broker permits clients to use leverage through margin, or ‘initial margin’ expressed
        as a percentage (a portion of your account held by the broker to ensure the trader has the means to
        cover any potential losses). Think of initial margin as a ‘good-faith deposit’ to trade, which,
        assuming risk is controlled by the trader is returned once the trade is settled.</p>

    </p>
    <p class="p-txt">A common misconception about trading with leverage is that leverage is a loan in CFDs.
        This is not true. CFDs are based on agreements (contracts between two parties). In FX, we do not
        trade the underlying market. We trade derivatives in the form of contracts based on the underlying
        market. As an example, if we trade 1 standard lot on EUR/USD at $1.13528 (100,000 units of the base
        currency), we are, with a USD trading account, trading at 10 USD per pip (if we trade 10,000 units,
        pip value would be 1 USD each pip). With leverage of 100:1, this requires you deposit 1 percent as
        initial margin: 1,135.28 USD (If the account is denominated in EUR, initial margin would be 1,000
        EUR). Trading on margin ‘grants’ traders access to a larger position size: increased exposure. </p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        <b>&bull; Over-the-Counter Market </b>
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt">Two primary avenues exist to trade in the financial markets: the over-the-counter
        market (OTC) and exchange-based trading. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">OTC operates between two parties (as in the CFD market), built through decentralised
        dealer networks. Exchange-based trading is considered more structured, a forum that limits
        counterparty risk. </p>
    <p class="h-txt-cus">Advantages of CFD Trading</p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        &bull; CFDs are leveraged products, meaning you’re only required to deposit a small amount of the
        notional position (initial margin) to trade.
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        &bull; The ability to trade both rising and falling markets.
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        &bull; CFD positions have no fixed expiration date and cash settled (no physical delivery).
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        &bull; Since you don't own the underlying asset when trading CFDs, there is no stamp duty to pay in
        the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, market participants are subject to capital gains tax (CGT). Tax
        treatment, of course, will depend on your individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        &bull; Market access. CFDs opens the door to global markets from one trading platform.
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        &bull; Cost efficient.
