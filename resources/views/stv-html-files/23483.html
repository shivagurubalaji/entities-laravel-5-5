Direct Market Access (DMA) System that allows traders to execute their trades directly on the exchanges.  DMA means that they do not have to rely on market making firms or dealers to carry out their trades. More recently, DMA brokers have emerged offering retail investors the opportunity to access market rates and trade directly on exchanges.</p>

            <p class="normal-para-font">As the name suggests, Direct Market Access (DMA) is access to the electronics systems and orders books of an exchange, such as the LSE, ASX, or the forex market. DMA trading is possible for exchange traded products only and it is a preferred method of professional traders rather than using the services of an intermediary firm.</p>
            <p class="normal-para-font">Financial exchanges are organised markets, where financial instruments including stocks, commodities, derivative products and other assets are traded. Retail traders gain direct access to these exchanges through intermediaries. Traditional trading routes would see a trader place an order through a software trading platform, which would go to a dedicated brokerage server, who would then relay the order to the servers at the exchange. The transaction would then be carried out at the exchange.</p>

            <div>
            <p class="normal-para-font">In the case of DMA trading, the trader enters an DMA order through a software trading platform which reaches the exchange servers directly. Besides doing away with the intermediary, this method of electronic trading allows traders access to the exchange’s order book which lists all the buy and sell orders. </p>
            <p class="normal-para-font">Since the number of transactions that are executed on a single exchange on a daily basis run into millions, direct access to their platforms is possible only through technologically advanced infrastructure or specially developed trading platforms. The simplified order flow process creates a highly efficient markets place where traders on the buy-side side able to view the offer price and easily determine the transaction costs.</p>

                <p class="normal-para-font">Brokerage firms, acting as intermediaries between traders and exchanges, have direct market access for executing the trading orders. In addition to this, sell-side investment banks generally have direct market access, which is used to execute trades on their behalf. Since the whole process of getting direct market access involves a lot of investment in technology and infrastructure, it can be quite expensive, which means only big players have access to it.</p>

The use of DMA allows the broker to execute trades directly on the respective order book of an exchange.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Established brokers offer both the market maker route and DMA options for trading, while laying down the terms for both types of trading clearly. Reputable and regulated brokers also distinguish between the different charges to ensure transparency of commissions and spreads. This helps their clients make informed decisions.</p>

With DMA, traders have access to live rates and can, therefore, act as market participants themselves. They have the option of submitting offers even before accepting a quote.

Sellers are liquidity providers or market makers and are responsible for the sale of financial instruments. On the other end are buyers who may include retail investors or management companies. These transactions take place at exchanges where both the buy and sell prices are quoted. </p>
                                        <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">Apart from the various financial instruments, traders can also invest in Contracts for Difference (CFDs). Unlike a traditional stock exchange, CFDs are contracts that allow traders to gain exposure to a market without actually taking possession of the underlying asset. These contracts are between a CFD provider and trader where the settlement is the difference between the opening and closing prices of the contract. The quoted prices of CFDs are based on the market price of the underlying asset. Aside from the spread, CFD prices basically mirror the prices found in the equivalent stock market. The CFD provider takes the orders from their clients and then places them in the direct exchanges or markets. The CFD provider in this case is a market maker.</p>

This is done by the provider to hedge their exposure. The order placed by the provider in the direct market is an individual order mirroring the price, volume and other instructions of the CFD order placed by the client.</p>

They do not actually buy or sell the underlying instrument but enter into a contract for difference with the broker at a price based on the underlying market price. The broker then hedges this price by placing a cash order in the order book on their own behalf.

So, trading via DMA brokers and market makers differs on several counts:</p>
                                                        <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10 visible-xs" style="text-align:left;margin-bottom: -5px;">This operational structure is called a dealing desk. In contrast, DMA brokers do not pass the orders of their clients through a dealing desk and thus are called 'No Dealing Desk' brokers.

This determined the speed of its execution and the size of the spread. DMA promotes higher levels of market liquidity as a result of an increased amount of buyers and sellers at all times.</p>
                                                        <p class="normal-para-font">In contrast, a market maker is making the market. In this case, the broker is providing the pricing that is used for buying and selling of contracts. The prices quoted by the broker tend to be not be as good as the real markets, but they incorporate the cost of the risk being absorbed by the broker. A major advantage of this type of trading is the level of liquidity. Market makers execute trades at a much faster speed than DMA brokers. This is because the broker is the counterparty for the trade.</p>

Also, they may reject orders and requote prices which may result in delayed trades. This is not the case for DMA brokers, since trading is live and real time.</p>

While DMA brokers may charge their clients higher commissions than a market maker, there are no added spreads, since trades are carried out at live market prices. Market makers determine the spreads on the basis of demand and supply for the underlying instrument and their own risk tolerance.</p>

Market makers offset trades against other traders or buy options or futures, or buy the underlying instrument in the open market. On the other hand, a DMA  broker will not necessarily hedge trades. They will instead take the opposite side of their client’s trade.</p>

It is important to develop a trading plan that includes goals, risk/reward appetite and risk management techniques. This will allow you to make the most of the financial markets.</p>
