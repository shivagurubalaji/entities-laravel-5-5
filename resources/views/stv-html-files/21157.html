                Commodities Defined
            </h2>
            <p>There are two types of commodities, hard and soft commodities. Hard commodities (also referred to as raw
                commodities) are mostly mined and consist of natural resources such as oil, natural gas and precious
                metals. Soft commodities (also referred to as agricultural commodities) are produced or grown products
                such as grain, coffee and sugar. For convenience, in trading, commodities are sorted into four groups:
                metals, energy, agriculture and livestock.


            </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.fpmarkets.com/commodities/" style="color: #00aeef;">Commodity trading</a>
                is a method to diversify one's portfolio beyond traditional securities. Still, it
                carries a high degree of uncertainty because commodity prices are susceptible to unpredictable phenomena
                such as floods, hot weather, wars, interest rates, etc. Some speculators refer to past performance to
                determine the market price of a commodity by following technical analysis principles whereby they
                observe historical price action and chart patterns to arrive at trade-worthy conclusions. Others rely on
                fundamental analysis and investment advice from trained professionals. There is a range of commodities
                to invest in for both short-term and long-term strategies, as well as financial instruments to choose
                from in the stock market, futures exchange and other markets.

            <p>Commodities are as ancient as ancient history, for it has existed ever since people needed or wanted
                something that someone else had. They play such an essential role in our lives that in 2021 the global
                value of commodities reached a record high of $28.5 trillion (UNCTAD, 2022). Commodities are exchanged
                across the globe to build our cities, feed our livestock, fuel our cars and make our phones. They have
                been used to value a nation's currency and provide us with simple pleasures, such as a warm cup of
                coffee brewed from coffee beans harvested in the valleys of Columbia.

            <p>As mentioned, in the world of financial markets, commodities are typically categorised under metals,
                energy, agriculture and livestock. There are many ways to invest in commodities, including direct
                investment, commodity futures contracts, commodity <a

                the Prices of Commodities

            </h2>


            <p>The extraction, development and transportation of commodities depend on many unpredictable factors. This
                is one of the main reasons why commodity trading is risky because no matter how much data and market
                analysis tools we possess, there are just certain things that are entirely out of our control.

            </p>
            <p><b>Weather</b> – Severe weather conditions can harm agricultural products. Such was the case in 2021 in
                Sao
                Paolo, Brazil, whereby the coffee plants of the largest coffee producer in the world were damaged by
                floods and frost (Araujo, 2022). This led to a worldwide increase in the price of coffee, as demand was
                high, but supply was low. NASA is also predicting that by 2030, climate change may affect the production
                of corn and wheat under a scenario of increased greenhouse gas emissions (Gray, 2021).

            </p>
            <p><b>Economic Sanctions</b> – With the increase in globalisation, economic sanctions imposed on one nation
                can affect the price of commodities paid by other countries. This can be seen in the war between Ukraine
                and Russia. To a greater extent, Russia does not have natural gas liquefaction capabilities, forcing
                them to transport natural gas via pipelines. Most of those pipelines lead towards Europe. The trade
                restrictions imposed on Russia led to Russia cutting off the gas supply to Europe, which resulted in
                increased natural gas prices in Europe. Such circumstances create severe economic impacts, but they also
                inspire countries to strengthen relations and take alternative approaches, leading to the innovation of
                superior technologies and new trading opportunities (Tian, 2022).

            </p>
            <p><b>Transportation Costs</b> – An increase in fuel price can increase the price of the commodity being
                delivered. This is because our transportation system operates on fuel like petrol and diesel. If the
                price of diesel goes up, so will the cost of transporting goods, which has the ripple effect of making
                goods sold in our stores more expensive. Higher transportation costs to deliver goods means finding
                higher prices on our supermarket shelves.


            </p>
            <p><b>Exchange Rates </b> – The lower the domestic currency value, the more amount of money will be required
                to buy goods from overseas. This is of particular interest to importing and exporting businesses that
                depend on the supply of materials from foreign countries to produce their goods. If it is expensive to
                buy the material from overseas to make a good, then that good will end up being expensive as well.

                Hard Commodities VS Soft Commodities</h2>

            <p><b>Soft commodities</b> are commodities that are grown and cared after. Some examples are coffee, cotton,
                rice,
                sugar, livestock etc. They are not as well defined as hard commodities and play a significant role in
                the futures market. This is because they are susceptible to weather and pathogen uncertainties, which
                makes it essential for farmers and investors, for instance, to lock in the future price of their crops.

            </p>
            <p><b>Hard commodities</b> are commodities that are extracted and mined rather than planted and nurtured to
                maturity. Some examples are oil, natural gas, gold and rubber. They are generally situated in similar
                geological deposits across the globe, unlike soft commodities that depend more on regional climate
                conditions.

            </div>
            <p>Some metal commodities are gold, copper and platinum. Gold is extremely popular and can be found in
                almost all our electronic devices. Its attractive colour, resistance to tarnish and rarity are some
                attributes that make it unique. Copper, amongst other places, is used in the building industry and
                industrial machinery production. Platinum might surprise some as it is used in the glass industry to
                manipulate molten glass. <a href="https://www.fpmarkets.com/metals/" style="color: #00aeef;">Metal CFDs
                </a>can be traded against the Australian or US Dollar as a
                currency pair

                Examples of energy commodities include natural gas and crude oil. Traders investing in this sector need
                to be cautious of economic downturns, technological advancements in alternative energy sources and
                shifts in production enforced by intergovernmental organisations, such as the Organisation of the

            <p>Corn, wheat, rice, sugar, cocoa, coffee, cotton and soybeans are all examples of agricultural
                commodities. These commodities are volatile to severe climate changes and increased transportation
                costs, which make them attractive to traders because a low supply, in combination with an increase in
                demand, leads to higher commodity prices and increased potential earnings.

                Livestock commodities refer to commodities such as live cattle, pork bellies, lean hogs and feeder
                cattle. Pathogens like the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Asia and Europe, increased
                production costs and market uncertainties across key exporting regions influence the price of livestock
                commodities worldwide (Upali W., 2021).

            <p>
                Both oil and oil-related assets are traded on the financial markets. A popular choice is Brent Crude and
                WTI as they serve as oil benchmarks in the global markets. Crude oil is the raw natural form of
                gasoline, jet fuel and other petroleum products before they are refined for their purpose. It is a
                non-renewable resource, which means that it can't be naturally replaced at a fast enough rate that we
                consume it, which makes it a finite resource and attractive to traders.

                Gold holds a distinctive position in the world of economics and political systems. It can be traded in
                its direct physical form or through a gold ETF, futures or mutual fund. It isn't tricky to trade this
                yellow metal commodity, but it does require a skill set unique to its features. Alternatively, trading
                gold without knowledge of what affects its value can lead to hidden pitfalls. Before trading gold, it is
                advisable first to understand the fundamental driving factors that influence its price, such as
                inflation and deflation, supply and demand.

                Physical Commodity Trading

            </h2>

            <p>
                Physical commodity trading is about taking raw material from where it is produced and delivering it to
                an area where it is consumed. So, companies involved in physical commodity trading secure a supply of
                commodities from the producer and market them across the world to end users or wholesalers. These
                companies add value to the supply chain because of their unique knowledge of transportation, risk
                hedging and financing. They deal in huge volumes and often reside in favourable legal environments such
                as Singapore, the UK and Switzerland.

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #000000;">14. Derivatives
                Trading</h2>

            <p>
                In trade, derivates are a contract between two or more parties that derives its value from an underlying
                asset like stocks, indices and commodities. The five main types of derivatives in trading are futures,
                forwards, options, swaps and Contract For Differences (<a
                    href="https://www.fpmarkets.com/what-is-cfd-trading/" style="color: #00aeef;">CFDs</a>). In the
                commodities market, traders use
                derivatives to fix a price for a particular underlying commodity, to manage their risk and protect
                themselves from market fluctuations.


            </p>
            <p>
                To take an example, let's say a car manufacturer calculates that they need five tonnes of steel to build
                enough cars to supply their customers for the following year. Through derivative trading, the
                manufacturer will agree with the steel supplier to buy five tonnes of steel at a predetermined date and
                a fixed price. The reason why a manufacturer may prefer to trade in such a manner, rather than to buy
                the commodity Over The Counter (OTC), is because the price of steel may rise, which would then make the
                trade more expensive. For the same reason, it may benefit the supplier to also trade the commodity at a
                predetermined date and fixed price because the price of aluminium can also drop, which would mean a loss
                for the supplier. Hence, by trading through derivatives, both the manufacturer and supplier can protect
                themselves from any detrimental price fluctuations and rely on the fixed price to continue their
                business endeavours.

                Trade Commodities


            </h2>
            <p>
                Futures are a financial derivative whereby you enter a contract to buy or sell a particular asset at a
                specific price and time in the future. Investors can use futures to speculate and hedge on price
                movements. Futures are usually utilised when trading commodities because it allows commodity traders to
                limit their risk related to price fluctuations. Some other key advantages of futures trading are access
                to leverage and portfolio diversification.

                Commodities Trading and How to Manage them

            </h2>
            <p>
                The risk in commodity trading is the risk that businesses face when there is a change in the price or
                availability of a commodity. The risk management companies take in commodity trading involves the steps
                they take to limit their potential loss and includes strategies like hedging through the use of a
                futures contract, a forward contract and an options contract.



            </p>
            <p>
                Four main commodity risks need to be considered when trading commodities. There is a price risk whereby
                the price may move adversely due to macroeconomic factors. This can also lead to a risk in cost for
                businesses due to the adverse price movement of a commodity. There is a risk of quantity when a
                commodity cannot be produced and supplied fast enough to cover demand. Finally, there is also the risk
                of regulatory changes which prevent businesses or makes it more costly for them to gain access to
                commodities, like what happens during wars and the cut-off of supply chains.




            </p>
            <p>
                The approach that businesses take to manage their risk will depend on their organisational structure
                (whether they are a producer or a buyer of commodities). Some risk management approaches include:





            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Diversification</b> – Farmers may decide to rotate their crop production to include different
                products to
                reduce their exposure to commodity price volatilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Price pooling arrangement</b> – This is when businesses collectively sell a commodity to an
                authorised group, with the purpose of setting an average commodity price based on various market
                factors.

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Futures contract</b> – Commodity buyers and sellers enter a futures contract to purchase or sell a
                commodity at a fixed price and a predetermined date in the future.

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Options contract</b> – These contracts give a company the right, but not the obligation, to buy or
                sell a commodity at a future date.

            </ul>
            <p>
                Remember, the commodities market is known for its volatility to price fluctuations. So before engaging,
                make sure to research in depth the commodity that you choose to trade with and understand the various
                factors that affect its value.

                Commodities to Trade</h2>

            <p>Choosing a commodity to trade with will depend on individual preferences and areas of expertise. It is
                preferable to work with a commodity that you understand. The alternative can lead to losses that could
                have been avoided had the necessary research taken place. Trading commodities is risky because it is
                volatile to a multitude of uncontrollable factors like severe weather conditions and political agendas.
                However, with sound research and risk management strategies, a trader can choose a commodity to trade
                confidently and benefit from commodity price fluctuations with limited risk.
