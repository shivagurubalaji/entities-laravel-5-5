                        much more significant and direct impact on its local currency. However, their impact is usually
                        short-lived. This is because experts from across the world use sophisticated measures and
                        analytics to make predictions of economic releases. Moreover, there are indicators of how good
                        or bad the data might be. </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Let’s take the US NFP (non-farm payroll) report for instance. This is
                        the most market moving economic release. Days or even weeks before the release, experts from
                        every corner of the world issue their forecast of the headline figure. Moreover, the initial
                        jobless claims report gives an indication of the strength or weakness of the next NFP headline
                        figure. Let’s say, despite all this, the report misses or beats expectations. Thanks to
                        technological advancements, traders and investors are quick to respond to the report. Yes, there
                        will initially be wide price swings but, after a few hours of this high volatility, the forex

                            style="font-size: 24px;font-weight: 600;line-height: 30px;">Political Stability</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Countries with a low risk of political uncertainty are more
                            attractive for foreign entities to make investments. Due to this, political stability
                            increases demand for a nation's currency and has a meaningful impact on forex rates. For
                            instance, Switzerland is known for its political stability, maintaining a neutral stance,
                            and staying away from conflicts with other nations. This is why the Swiss franc enjoys a
                            safe-haven status in foreign exchange trading and is also used for hedging risks in other
                            currencies.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">On the other hand, protests, coops, and political chaos have a
                            destabilising impact on the economy and weakens the local currency. This reduces demand for
                            the respective domestic currency and increases the risk of holding it.</p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font">The extent to which a government controls the economy can have a
                            meaningful impact on the currency. These governments typically manage their currency very
                            closely. However, given the increased mobility of capital in a highly globalised world, such
                            governments need to take increasingly stronger measures to control the economy and currency,
                            resulting in greater uncertainty and, in turn, high volatility in the forex market.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="padding-top-25">

                            Fiscal Policy</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font visible-xs"
                            style="font-size: 24px;font-weight: 600;line-height: 30px;">Government’s Fiscal Policy</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Fiscal policy involves the government’s plans on spending over a
                            certain period of time. The government collects tax and takes on debt to finance various
                            projects. Higher government spending boosts economic growth, as there is an influx of money
                            into the economy, which propels business activity and is used to pay wages and purchase
                            other products. Therefore, an increase in government spending raises the value of the
                            country's currency. </p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">The benefits of an increase in government spending are short-lived
                            if it is funded by higher national debt rather than through tax collection. An increase in
                            government debt erodes the demand for the local currency and exerts pressure on its exchange
                            rate. Large public debt is also a sign of upcoming instability, as there is a higher risk of
                            default, which deters foreign investors and reduces demand for the currency.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">On the other hand, low government debt suggests a more fiscally
                            responsible government and greater economic stability. For instance, Australia’s national
                            debt tends to remain low versus other developed countries, lending support to the Australian
                            dollar.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">The corona-virus pandemic is an extremely unique non-macroeconomic
                            event. Border closures and a decrease in labour input have decreased the gross domestic
                            product (GDP) of most nations across the world. The anticipation of lock-downs may have
                            brought about a short-term spike in retail sales and consumer spending but the long-term
                            trends are looking grim. The financial services sector has had to strengthen its risk
                            management strategies and a decrease in lending by banks has been felt by the real estate
                            market. These are all factors that impact the foreign exchange market and emphasise the
                            unique set of political conditions that governments are currently faced with.</p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font">While these are regular events that take place in almost every
                            country, some elections attract more investor focus. During any election race there is a
                            large focus on the economic policies of the respective parties and the potential impact they
                            will have on a country's economy. Moreover, the government has a meaningful impact on the
                            diplomatic relations with other countries. For instance, a government that maintains
                            diplomatic relations may ink trade deals with other countries which strengthens the economy
                            and boosts demand for the local currency. This is recognised as a positive indicator of
                            economic performance as it minimises the risk of political turmoil.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">A tightly contested election that has candidates with starkly
                            different economic and cross-border ideologies can cause great uncertainty. This translates
                            into high volatility in the forex market in the run up to election results. For instance,
                            Italy’s elections in 2018 caused significant volatility and a downtrend in the euro, given
                            prospects of a populist government and a possible clash with the EU. There is a perception
                            that Donald Trump and Joe Biden offer drastically different visions for the United States
                            economy. A direct impact on forex trading is inevitable with any currency pair including the
                            US dollar expected to trade noticeably higher volumes than normal.</p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font">Apart from fiscal policy, the government has a say in the central
                            bank’s monetary policies. Even countries that favour floating exchange rates do their best
                            to control the demand and supply of money. The central bank of a country influences money
                            supply by making changes in the interest rate. By lowering the interest rate, a country can
                            deflate the value of its currency in a bid to make its exports more price competitive. </p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font">The government may decide to print currency notes to increase money
                            supply. Such efforts are termed as quantitative easing and became a popular method in the US
                            and Europe to combat the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">During periods of economic slowdown or recession, governments can
                            inject money into the economy or even into the financial markets. For instance, the US
                            government injected $2 trillion in the economy in March 2020, only to be followed by another
                            $3 trillion package in May, in response to the covid-19 pandemic. In March, the funds had a
                            more direct impact on the financial markets. This is because a large part of the funds was
                            handed out to all American adults, while some were used to increase unemployment benefits.
                            Many people used the funds to speculate on <a class="custom-link-for-a" href="#"><b>the
                                    stock and forex markets</b></a>. In May, the government distributed funds to
                            healthcare organisations and pharma companies, to provide free coronavirus testing and
                            treatment and conduct research on vaccines. Some of the funds were given to small businesses
                            to cover payroll and overhead expenses in an attempt to limit bankruptcy.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Broadly speaking, political stability, friendly diplomatic relations
                            and fiscal discipline are indicators of economic growth that help strengthen the value of
                            the currency. On the other hand, political unrest, conflict with other countries and poor
                            fiscal decisions can be detrimental to a domestic economy and its legal tender. The allies
                            and enemies of a country can also have a meaningful impact on the currency exchange rate. A
                            strong ally can increase foreign investments in a country, while a strong enemy can increase
                            risk for investors. </p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-40 pad-top-20-imp-mob">Due to all these factors, it is
                            vital for <a class="custom-link-for-a" href="/forex/"><b>forex traders</b></a> to remain
                            abreast of political news. Forex traders should focus on major global political events such
                            as the US election and take them into consideration as part of their trading strategy. More
                            importantly, additional focus should be placed on news that influences the currencies in
                            their portfolio. If a large percentage of a traders portfolio involved the US dollar, they
                            should be well informed with respect to political and economic news involving the United
                            States. This would include awareness around the Dow Jones and significant political events
                            such as the 2020 US election.</p>

                    <p class="normal-para-font">The US-China trade war is a double-edged sword for the forex market.
                        Deteriorating diplomatic relations between two countries has an impact on their currencies.
                        Added to this is the fact that the US-China standoff is related to trade, which has a much
                        deeper impact on the forex market.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">The tug-of-war between the Trump Administration and China
                        began over issues such as theft of Intellectual Property, forced technology transfer, China
                        limiting access to its market, and the preferential treatment provided to the Asian nation’s
                        state-owned enterprises. </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">By July 2018, the US had imposed tariffs on $34 billion
                        worth of Chinese imports. China protected itself from this situation by devaluing the yuan to
                        negate the impact of the tariffs. Currency devaluation is a common strategy adopted by countries
                        faced by a trade war. This is a logical response to aggressive tariffs and is not a new
                        phenomenon. </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">Why is it logical? High tariffs imposed by Country A on
                        Country B increases the price of products exported by Country B to Country A. This is a
                        protectionist policy that makes Country B’s products less price competitive in the domestic
                        market of Country A. In an attempt to combat this increase in price, Country B can resort to
                        currency devaluation, which involves lowering the exchange rate between its local currency and
                        Country A’s currency. As Country B’s currency is now cheaper, its exports to Country A regain
                        their price competitiveness. </p>

                    <p class="normal-para-font">Why is this not a new phenomenon? For years, Japan’s Prime Minister
                        Shinzo Abe followed a policy of quantitative easing and negative interest rates that kept the
                        yen’s (JPY) exchange rate in check and favoured the country’s exports.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">Between July 2018 and August 2019, the US had announced
                        plans to impose tariffs on more than $550 billion worth of imports from China, including
                        commodities like steel, light machinery, and appliances. The Asian nation retaliated with
                        tariffs on more than $185 billion worth of US products. In fact, it raised tariffs on almost all
                        exports from America, from pharmaceuticals to whiskey.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">By October 2019, the US-China trade war had already
                        shaved off almost $500 billion from the global economy. This situation worsened with the onset

                        </p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">The US dollar began 2018 on a downtrend, mainly due to growth in
                            other leading economies of the world, especially in Europe. The US Dollar Index, which
                            measures the value of the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell to a low of
                            88.59 on February 15. </p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">The beginning of the trade war with China resulted in extreme
                            volatility in the US dollar. The greenback then began an uptrend, although it remained
                            volatile amid uncertainties related to the fallout of the US-China trade war. The US Dollar
                            Index hit its 2018 high on November 12, climbing to 97.54, and ended the year at 96.17. </p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">The US dollar strengthened in the first half of 2019. In fact, the
                            greenback was on a clear month-on-month uptrend through the first six months of that year,
                            backed by interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, strong economic growth, and a low
                            unemployment rate. </p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">The greenback continued its ascend, albeit at a slower pace, for the
                            next couple of months. On September 3, 2019, the US Dollar Index hit a two-year high and
                            came very close to breaching the 100 mark. Then came a period of intensifying trade war
                            tensions, which saw the US dollar weaken.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">China stepped up its fight in the trade war by further devaluing its
                            currency. The yuan plummeted nearly 4% versus the US dollar in August 2019, representing its
                            biggest monthly decline in more than two decades. The geopolitical tensions not only
                            impacted the US dollar and the Chinese yuan. It impacted almost all currencies around the
                            world. What made the impact more pronounced and widespread is the trade war was between the
                            two largest economies of the world.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">As China devalued its currency, other countries like New Zealand and
                            Thailand implemented a monetary policy to weaken their currencies so that their exports
                            remained price competitive. The Argentine peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira also
                            plummeted.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Latin American currencies were the most volatile, as their economies
                            are highly dependent on trade. Any news related to the standoff between Washington and
                            Beijing resulted in wide price swings in these currencies. Among G-10 currencies, the
                            Canadian dollar exhibited the highest volatility to political tensions between the US and
                            China, as it is a commodity currency. The Australian dollar was not far behind the Loonie in
                            its response to such news. This is mainly because the tensions impacted the economy of China
                            which is Australia’s largest trading partner.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">In December 2019, the US President said the first phase of a trade
                            deal with China would be signed in January 2020. Despite the uncertainties around the
                            details of such an agreement, the pound, the euro and other trade-sensitive currencies
                            rallied, sending the US dollar to a six-month low. This was driven by an increase in
                            investor risk appetite with the prospects of political tensions easing between Washington
                            and Beijing.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">The currencies that benefited the most from the geopolitical
                            tensions were those that act as safe havens, namely the Swiss franc and Japanese yen. As you
                            can see, there is a direct correlation between politics and the forex market.</p>

                    <p class="normal-para-font">Brexit, or Britain’s exit from the European Union, has had a significant
                        and prolonged impact on the forex market. Here’s a look at the various <a
                            class="custom-link-for-a" href="/blog/the-brexit-files-the-possible-permutations/"><b>Brexit
                                developments</b></a> and how they impacted the British pound, leading to an
                        unprecedented downward spiral extending for more than three years. Here is how it all happened:
                    </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">On June 23, 2016, the UK voted in favour of exiting the
                        EU. Theresa May formed a government in July, following which withdrawal negotiations began. This
                        sent shockwaves in the markets, resulting in panic selling. The global stock market lost $2
                        trillion within 24 hours of the results being announced. The British pound tumbled, and the
                        GBP/USD lost almost 8% to mark the biggest single-day selloff since World War II. </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">The pound lost 15% versus the euro and 17% against the
                        Australian dollar. As uncertainties continued, the pound kept sliding over the next six months,
                        losing almost 20% against the US dollar. On March 29, 2017, when PM May triggered Article 50,
                        which set the date for Britain’s formal departure from the EU exactly two years later, the pound
                        plummeted. The GBP/USD reached a low of 1.2441 that day.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">The Brexit withdrawal agreement was published on November
                        14, 2018, followed by the EU member states endorsing the agreement. Prospects of a no-deal
                        Brexit grabbed the headlines, sending the market in a frenzy. The pound lost around 2% against
                        the US dollar and the euro.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">As the agreed date for Brexit (March 29, 2019)
                        approached, the pound became highly volatile, although the general direction continued to be
                        downward. On April 10, the UK and EU27 agreed to extend the Brexit date to October 31, 2019.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6 pad-left-40">
                <div>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">In May 2019, the pound started recovering. This was driven by another
                        political event which played a key role in supporting the pound against both the US dollar and
                        the euro. Theresa May resigned as the Conservative Party leader, making way for Boris Johnson to
                        become the Prime Minister. Although markets initially welcomed PM Johnson with a rally in the
                        British pound, soon fear gripped investors as his rhetoric on Brexit toughened and hopes of
                        Britain inking a deal with the EU faded. The pound plummeted on July 28 to hit a 28-month low of
                        $1.2242. The sterling also lost ground against the euro, reaching €1.1004.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">Through October 2019, the pound remained mostly range
                        bound, as EU leaders approved UK PM Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal and set the date of November 1
                        for the agreement to come into force. However, the British currency spiked in December, to reach
                        its highest level in more than a year, on news of Boris Johnson winning the elections. </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">Finally, on January 31, 2020, the UK exited the EU and
                        the British pound ended the month with significant gains against other major currencies.
                        Although this should have been a stabilising factor, volatility continued. Months after the
                        Brexit, the UK and EU were still negotiating a deal, with “neither breakdown nor breakthrough”
                        on major issues. In fact, in March 2020, the GBP/USD reported a new low of around 1.16.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">Not only is Brexit a recent example of how politics can
                        affect the forex market, it is a great example as Brexit has a significant and prolonged impact.

                        the world play a key role in the overall economic health and prospects of a country and,
                        therefore, on its currency. Even forex traders who use <a class="custom-link-for-a"
                            href="/blog/category/technical-analysis/"><b>technical analysis</b></a> to make decisions
                        need to monitor political news and be aware of the most important events to anticipate
                        fluctuations in the currencies they trade. The need to remain abreast of politics is higher
                        during periods of an economic slowdown as their capacity to cause market fluctuations increases.

                    <p class="normal-para-font">Politics can have a more meaningful impact on the forex market than even
                        economic factors. This is because political developments are not onetime events and their
                        outcomes are often more difficult to predict than economic releases. Moreover, political
                        ideologies can influence how closely a government controls the economy and impacts growth
                        through its fiscal and monetary policies. </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">Broadly speaking, the forex market prefers periods of
                        peace in a country and the absence of conflict between nations. The value of a currency is
                        supported by how pro-growth and fiscally responsible for the government of the country is. That
                        said, political events and uncertainty lead to volatility which is seen as favourable by many
                        forex traders. They view volatility as a vehicle for creating trading opportunities and look to
                        capitalise on them by altering their trading strategy.</p>
