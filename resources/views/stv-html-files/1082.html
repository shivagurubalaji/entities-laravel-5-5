    <p class="p-txt">The terminology used in financial markets is confusing for beginners. It’s akin to learning the
        foundations of a new language; consequently, the absence of proficiency in basic terms makes operating in any
        tradeable market (country) problematic. </p>

    <p class="p-txt">
        Specifically, in the foreign exchange market—more commonly referred to as the <i>Forex market</i>—a ‘pip’ is an
        important term that Forex traders must have a firm grasp on to navigate FX charts confidently. A pip, an acronym
        for <i>percentage in point</i> or <i>price interest point</i>, represents a unit of measurement: a currency
        pair’s unit of change, equal to 1/100th of 1 per cent. Put simply, think of it as one unit of a per cent that
        denotes the smallest price movement of an exchange rate.

    </p>
    <p class="h-txt-cus">Currency Pairs</p>
    <p class="p-txt">The Forex market operates through currency pairs that deliver rates of exchange. An exchange rate
        presents the value of one country’s currency in terms of another country’s currency, hence its name: <i>currency
            pair</i> or <i>Forex pair</i>. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">In each currency pair, irrespective of the currencies involved, a base currency and a term currency
        establish their framework. The base currency is stationed on the left-hand side of the quotation (the first
        currency) and signifies a whole number (one unit) of the base currency. The term currency accommodates the
        right-hand side of the quotation (the second currency) and is also referred to as either a <i>counter
            currency</i>, a <i>secondary currency</i>, or a <i>quote currency</i>. A currency pair’s structure remains
        the same irrespective of whether major currency pairs are traded or less liquid (and often more volatile) exotic
        currency pairs are explored. </p>
    <p class="h-txt-cus">Decimal Places</p>
    <p class="p-txt">Although dependent on the Forex broker, with the exception of JPY pairs (Japanese yen) priced to
        three decimal points (0.010), the majority of currency pairs are priced to five decimal places (0.00010). The
        fifth (third) value is what’s known as a <i>point</i>—sometimes called a <i>fractional pip</i> or <i>pipette</i>
        (a tenth of a single pip). </p>
    <p class="p-txt">Trading platforms, such as MetaTrader 4 (MT4), deliver bid and ask quotes through its Market Watch
        window, as shown in figure 1.A. The bid (ask) represents the value in which traders can sell (buy) the base
        currency. </p>

    <span>(Figure 1.A: MetaTrader 4 [MT4] Market Watch Window) </span>
    <p class="p-txt">To help solidify the concept of a pip, the GBP/USD (British pound against the U.S. dollar) currency
        pair, according to figure 1.A, has a bid of $1.25715. If the currency pair trades to $1.25745, this is a three
        pip move higher. Yet, should the pair trade from $1.25715 to $1.25718, this is a three-point advance.</p>
    <p class="h-txt-cus">Pip Value Calculation</p>
    <p class="p-txt">Although Forex traders often depend on Forex calculators, an important skill market participants
        should become accustomed to is pip value calculation. How this is calculated rests on the currency the trading
        account is denominated in and the currency pair of interest. </p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        <b>&bull; Account currency denominated in the same currency as the currency pair’s term currency: </b>
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Pip values, in this case, range from 0.10 units (micro lot),
        1.00 units (mini lot) and 10.00 units (standard lot). For currency pairs including the Japanese yen (JPY),
        however, 10.00 units (micro lot), 100.00 units (mini lot), and 1,000 units (standard lot) are used. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">Imagine a U.S. based investor who wants to purchase 10,000 euros and the EUR/USD (euro against the
        U.S. dollar) exchange rate is $1.20000. 12,000 USD is the cost to buy 10,000 euros, according to the current
        exchange rate. Assume the investor purchases 10,000 euros for 12,000 USD and holds the euros for one month, at
        which time EUR/USD trades to $1.21000 (100-pip advance). Should the investor sell the 10,000 euros at $1.21000,
        a 100 USD gain is realised (minus commissions). Notice that this is an unleveraged transaction and the pip value
        was 1 USD per pip. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">This pip value is identical to a U.S. investor that
            trades on margin</span>. In this case, the trader enters long (buy) EUR/USD ($1.20000) using one mini lot
        (10,000 units of the base currency [mini lot]). The trader then liquidates the position at $1.21000 for a 100
        USD gain (minus commissions).</p>

    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        <b>&bull; Account currency denominated in the same currency as the currency pair’s base currency: </b>
    </p>
    <p class="text-center p-txt">(One Pip / Exchange Rate) * Trade Size</p>
    <p class="p-txt">Trading EUR/USD with a euro-based account, for example, the trader (or investor) would need the pip
        movement value for euro in terms of USD: the term currency. Thus, when the term currency moves from, say,
        $1.20000 to $1.20100 (10-pip advance), the trader understands the USD equivalent in euro. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">To explain, for the EUR/USD trading at $1.20000, market participants know that 1 euro is equivalent
        to 1.20 USD. To understand the euro pip value equivalent, as shown in the formula above, divide the pip value
        (0.00010) by $1.20000 to equal 0.00008333333 (euro pip value), and subsequently multiply the value by trade
        size. If the trade size is 10,000 units, the pip value for the current example is:</p>
    <p class="text-center">0.83 euro per pip = (0.00010 / 1.20000) * 10,000 (mini lot size)</p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20">
        <b>&bull; Account currency denominated in a currency not associated with the currency pair of interest </b>
    </p>
    <p class="text-center p-txt">(One Pip / Conversion Exchange Rate) * Trade Size</p>
    <p class="p-txt">At times, traders must compute the pip worth of a position that exhibits no direct relationship
        between the account currency and the currency pair. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">The trick is to remember that the base currency of a currency pair is a whole number (an integer).
        It is the term currency that moves (decimal form) and is the price change visible on the y-axis of charts. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">As an illustration, a trader works with an account denominated in British pounds (GBP) and the
        currency pair traded is USD/CHF (U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc). Here, the trader must find the GBP pip
        value in CHF as GBP is the account currency and CHF is the term currency of the currency pair traded. Therefore,
        the conversion exchange rate used in this case is GBP/CHF (British pound versus the Swiss franc). Consequently,
        if CHF moves 1 pip higher, the trader must recognise the equivalent value of a pip in GBP. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">Assuming the trader works with a trade size of 10,000 units, the pip value in GBP, as per the
        formula above, is as follows:</p>
    <p class="text-center p-txt">0.80 GBP per pip = (0.00010 / GBP/CHF [CHF 1.24960]) * 10,000 units (mini lot size)</p>
