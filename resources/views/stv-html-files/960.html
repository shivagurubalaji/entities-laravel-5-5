                        case was reported in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The virus spread like a
                        wildfire. Hotspots quickly shifted throughout Asia from China to Japan and South Korea before
                        stretch to Italy, France, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The virus
                        had no borders and on March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak as a
                        pandemic.</p>
                    <p class="normal-parag-font padding-top-10">To curb the spread of the virus, governments of various
                        countries closed their borders and announced lockdowns of businesses, schools, shopping centres,
                        stadiums, and other places where large amounts of people would normally gather. As travel came
                        to a grinding halt and factories were forced to remain closed, the global economy spiralled. As
                        the death toll continued to rise, global markets plummeted. </p>

                        global financial markets, including equities, commodities, and forex. As black swan events tend
                        to do, the coronavirus crisis caused shock, panic and fear among investors around the world.
                        Despite this initial reaction, forex and other financial markets exhibited great resilience even
                        as confirmed cases continued to soar. </p>
                    <p class="normal-parag-font padding-top-10">In fact, trading volumes actually increased during this
                        crisis. Brokers around the world reported a rise in the number of client accounts as well as
                        orders being placed. Experts believe this increase in trading may have been a result of people
                        having more time on their hands amid work from home, travel restrictions and events being
                        cancelled as well as the initial decline in the global financial markets making various asset
                        classes more attractive to purchase.</p>
                    <p class="normal-parag-font padding-top-10">Meanwhile, governments announced several moves,
                        including stimulus packages and changes in the monetary policy, which had an impact on the
                        financial markets. Global trade starting coming to a halt with countries quickly facing supply
                        chain issues. The coronavirus pandemic quickly sank its teeth in - capital markets suffered with
                        the Dow Jones suffering two of its five largest percentage losses in the span of a week. To
                        understand the impact of such, let us first look at the various factors that influence the forex

                    <p class="normal-parag-font padding-top-20">The foreign exchange rate, or the rate at which the
                        currency of a country is converted into that of another, is a key indicator of the country’s
                        economic health and stability. The forex rate may fluctuate on a daily or even hourly basis, as
                        the demand and supply of the currency changes.</p>

                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Typically, when the inflation rate of a country increases, the
                            value of its currency declines. This is logical because inflation is essentially a measure
                            of a rise in the average price of a basket of goods and services of common use. This
                            includes things like food, clothing, transportation, housing, and consumer staples. As
                            prices rise, you need more money to buy the same basket of goods and services. In other
                            words, the value of money declines. Therefore, a rise in inflation eats into the value of a
                            currency and a decline in inflation results in the value of the currency appreciating. Even
                            if the inflation rate of a country remains consistently low, its currency value rises.</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Exception to the Rule: While this is the general rule, extremely
                            low or near zero inflation is not a good sign for the economy either. Near zero inflation or
                            deflation discourages consumers from spending (as they feel prices may remain the same or
                            fall in the future). Low inflation rates also make it less attractive to borrow and invest.
                            All these factors result in lower economic growth. A recovery from such a scenario is both
                            slow and fragile.</p>

                        <p class="normal-parag-font" style="font-size: 26.5px;font-weight: 600;">Trade Balance</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">The trade balance is a statement of exports and imports of a
                            country. Higher exports means there is higher demand for a country’s goods and services and,
                            therefore, higher demand for its currency. So, when exports grow, the value of the currency
                            appreciates. In the same vein, when imports rise, the currency depreciates. There is also a
                            balancing factor at play here. As a country’s currency depreciates, its exports become more
                            attractively priced in other currencies. This results in higher demand for its exports and,
                            therefore, for its currency, which lifts its exchange rate.</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Exception to the Rule: The US is a net importer and typically
                            reports a trade deficit. This does not mean the US dollar depreciates every time the US
                            announces a trade deficit. This is due to the greenback’s reserve currency status which
                            keeps the demand for the US dollar high and maintains its exchange rate.</p>

                        <p class="normal-parag-font" style="font-size: 26.5px;font-weight: 600;">National Debt</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">This is also known as government debt since it refers to the debt
                            of a country’s central government. The government is compelled to take a debt when it needs
                            to spend more than it has collated in taxes. Higher government debt lowers the
                            attractiveness of the country’s currency. On the other hand, a decline in government debt
                            lifts the country’s currency exchange rate. Consistently low national debt indicates a more
                            fiscally responsible government and a more stable economy. For instance, Australia’s
                            national debt remains low relative to other developed countries like the US, UK and Japan,
                            giving the impression of a more stable and resilient economy.</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Exception to Every Rule: A government surplus means that the
                            government spends less money than it collects as tax. Government spending is an important
                            factor boosting a country’s GDP. So, if the government spends less, it can have a negative
                            impact on the economy and, therefore, lower the value of its currency. </p>

                        <p class="normal-parag-font" style="font-size: 26.5px;font-weight: 600;">Interest Rates</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Central banks around the world, like the Federal Reserve, Reserve
                            Bank of Australia, European Central Bank, and Bank of England, set benchmark interest rates
                            for their respective regions. This is an important part of their monetary policy, as
                            interest rates are the most effective tool with respect to regulating the supply of money.
                            Changes in the interest rate affect the value of the local currency. An increase in the
                            interest rate results in currency appreciation. This is because higher interest rates
                            provide higher incomes to lenders, which attracts more foreign capital, thereby resulting in
                            a rise in exchange rates.</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Exception to the Rule: In emerging economies, interest rates tend
                            to be fairly high. When interest rates in these countries increase, it discourages
                            businesses from taking loans. This cripples economic activity and, in turn, has a negative
                            impact on the currency exchange rate.</p>

                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Balance of payments is a statement of all financial transactions
                            made between a country and the rest of the world. This includes the purchase and sale of
                            goods and services, as well as loans taken from foreign entities and investments made in the
                            country by foreign entities. </p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">The balance of payments includes two accounts, namely, the current
                            account and the capital account. The currency account shows all financial transactions
                            related to the purchase and sale of goods and services, while the capital account includes
                            financial transactions related loans and investments.</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">If a country imports more than it exports, this means it spends
                            more than it earns, resulting in a deficit in the current account. A currency account
                            deficit results in a decline in the value of its currency. Similarly, a capital account

                            that is witnessing a political turmoil becomes less attractive to foreign investors. A
                            relatable example is the souring relationship between the United States and China following
                            the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases and comments made by President Donald Trump. In fact, as
                            the situations heat, foreign investors may liquidate their investments and take funds back
                            to their home country. This decline in foreign capital lowers demand for the country’s
                            currency and exerts pressure on its exchange rate.</p>

                        stocks. It is impossible to keep track of all of them. The best way to stay in touch with the
                        stock market is to look at the leading indices. For instance, if you wish to trade the
                        Australian dollar, it is a good idea to keep an eye on the ASX 200. This is by far the most
                        popular Australian index and tracks the performance of the top 200 Australian-listed companies.
                        Some traders also track the S&P/ASX 200, which is a part of the main index that includes only
                        technology stocks. Similarly, if you are interested in trading the USD/JPY, it is a good idea to
                        keep an eye on the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500, which are the <a class="custom-link-for-a"
                            href="/indices/">most popular indices</a> that reflect the direction of the US stock market,
                        as well as the Nikkei 225, which reflects how Japanese stocks are moving.</p>
                    <p class="normal-parag-font">You may also wish to keep an eye on the <a class="custom-link-for-a"
                            href="/commodities/">commodities market</a>, depending on the currencies in your portfolio.
                        For instance, the Australian dollar is impacted by price movements in the commodity market,
                        since Australia is a large exporter of commodities. Similarly, the Canadian dollar is influenced
                        by changes in global oil prices, as crude oil constitutes Canada’s leading exports. The New
                        Zealand dollar is also considered a commodity currency.</p>

                        the Forex<br> Market?</p>
                    <p class="normal-white-para-font padding-top-10">In the first half of 2020, the global financial
                        markets witnessed unprecedented socio-economic challenges. Given investor fear and panic, there
                        were sharp declines in many asset classes. However, even amid this, there were periods of
                        optimism, highlighted by the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow hitting record highs. </p>
                    <p class="normal-white-para-font">The scale of the virus outbreak and the speed at which it spread
                        across the globe caused significant market volatility. This triggered a rise in trading volumes,
                        as wide price swings offer more attractive trading opportunities than a stable market. Most new
                        traders began with <a class="custom-link-for-a" href="/forex/">trading forex</a>, which has been
                        the trend since online trading gained popularity. This trend was even more pronounced during the
                        pandemic, as liquidity became the most important criterion for new traders.</p>
                    <p class="normal-white-para-font">One of the main advantages of trading forex is that it offers
                        equal opportunity in both bull and bear markets. This is because when one currency falls, it
                        does so against another currency. This means the other currency appreciates. The forex market
                        offered attractive trading opportunities even while other asset classes were on a downturn amid
                        the covid-19 crisis. </p>

                        </p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Unlike stocks, all currencies cannot simultaneously decline.
                            However, some currencies did fare much better than others during the pandemic. The main
                            reason was that these currencies have a safe-haven appeal. The demand for such currencies
                            remained high due to the pandemic-induced uncertainty and a decline in investor risk
                            appetite. The three main safe-haven currencies are:</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">The Japanese yen: This has always been a leading safe-haven asset
                            mainly due to Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor. This became even starker
                            during the coronavirus crisis, as countries took on massive government debt to inject funds
                            in a bid to revive their economy following months of lockdown.</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">The US dollar: This enjoys the status of the default safe-haven
                            currency, as it is the world's reserve currency. As various international trade,
                            cross-border business deals and financial assets are denominated in this currency, the US
                            dollar is the world’s most liquid currency. This supported the greenback during the covid-19
                            era. </p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">The US dollar was also supported by businesses and traders exiting
                            emerging market currencies. In the first half of 2020, capital outflows from emerging
                            markets were larger and faster than during any previous crisis. As businesses and traders
                            converted these currencies, the demand for the US dollar rose to three-year highs in March.
                        </p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">The Swiss franc: This is considered a safe-haven currency as
                            Switzerland has a relatively stable economy and is seen as a neutral country that stays away
                            from global conflict. The currency steadily rose, even against the US dollar which competes
                            with the Swiss franc for hedging risks in investor portfolios.</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Despite their safe-haven appeal, the major currencies came under
                            pressure as the pandemic progressed. This is because of government initiatives to support
                            their economies, including quantitative easing measures and interest rate cuts.</p>

                        <p class="normal-parag-font" style="font-size: 26.5px;font-weight: 600;">Interest rates</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Most central banks lowered interest rates in an effort to encourage
                            businesses to borrow funds to tide them through the covid-19 crisis. Declining interest
                            rates are negative for the local currency. For instance, on March 11, the Bank of England
                            slashed its base interest rate to 0.25%. This led to a sharp decline in the GBP/USD.</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Of course, the selloff was also caused by disappointing economic
                            data from the UK and Brexit uncertainties. On March 18, the GBP/USD crashed as low as
                            $1.1757, reaching its weakest level since 1985.</p>

                            Stimulus Package</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Governments globally announced stimulus packages of more than $10
                            trillion to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus. While relief packages are meant
                            to boost the economy, which should support the local currency, these packages increased
                            government debt, a major negative for the currency. For instance, on March 12, the European
                            Central Bank expanded its asset purchase program by €120 billion (approximately $136
                            billion). The EUR/USD plummeted following this announcement. </p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">On the other hand, any uncertainty around government stimulus also
                            adversely impacts the local currency. This was evident by the steady decline in the US
                            dollar against its major rivals including the Euro, Swiss franc, and British pound, caused
                            by the stalemate between the Congress and the White House regarding additional relief to
                            help cope with the pandemic. </p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Despite its safe-haven appeal, the US dollar traded close to
                            two-year lows in late July. This pressure on the US dollar resulted from high unemployment
                            rates (which had surged past levels recorded at the peak of the 2008 financial crisis) and a
                            more than 30% GDP contraction in the second quarter. Rising daily infections and
                            disappointing economic data resulted in a steady decline in the US Dollar Index, which
                            measures of the value of the greenback against a basket of currencies.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Commodity prices, oil prices and disappointing news related to
                            other economies also caused volatility in the forex market amid the pandemic. For instance,
                            the AUD/USD slipped to 17-year lows in March and April, with a decline in commodity prices
                            as well as China (Australia’s largest trading partner) reporting a 6.8% GDP contraction for
                            the first quarter of 2020.</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">In fact, any news of rising infections exerts pressure on the
                            Australian dollar, as it is considered as a “risk currency”. On the other hand, hopes of a
                            covid-19 vaccine lend support to the Aussie. </p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">Similarly, the CAD/USD came under significant pressure with
                            plummeting crude oil prices. Oil prices suffered a historic collapse on March 9, due to a
                            severe contraction in demand and Saudi Arabia’s efforts to increase its market share by
                            lowering prices. The Canadian dollar nosedived in tandem with oil prices. The currency
                            recovered after the OPEC reached a deal for member nations to simultaneously reduce
                            production to support prices.</p>
                        <p class="normal-parag-font">The Canadian dollar is a risk-sensitive currency and any upbeat
                            economic data suggesting a recovery of the global economic will support the Loonie.</p>

                        various countries around the world will continue to impact the forex market. Investor focus is
                        likely to remain on the health and progress of the Chinese economy. This is not only because
                        China is the world’s second largest economy, but also because it is the main driver of
                        manufacturing trends. Moreover, China was the first to experience the impact of covid-19, deal
                        with it and emerge from it, which is why investors view its progress as a blueprint for other

                    <p class="normal-parag-font">While the forex market is likely to remain volatile as the impact of
                        the pandemic plays out, the US dollar and the Japanese yen could regain their strength, as
                        investors and traders continue to hold safe-haven assets. As the global economy stabilises,
                        undervalued currencies such as the Singapore dollar, Mexican peso, Turkish lira, and South
                        African rand could deliver more sustained gains.</p>
