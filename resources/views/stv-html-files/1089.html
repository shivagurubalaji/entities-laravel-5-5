    <p class="p-txt">Gone are the days of hand gestures and face-to-face contact. Today, the majority of trading
        operations are facilitated through electronic trading systems. Consequently, understanding how traders and
        brokerages communicate through trading platforms is imperative. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">Like a saw is used for cutting solid material to prescribed lengths, order types are the tools
        used by market participants to express desired trading actions. While a number of types of orders exist,
        their main function is to enter and exit trades. </p>
    <p class="h-txt-cus">Market Order</p>
    <p class="p-txt">One of the simplest order types is a market order, an instruction to enter or exit (buy [long
        position] or sell [short position]) a security immediately at the next available price. Market orders,
        therefore, are commonly used by traders who deem current market prices as favourable entry or exit points.
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt">It is important to take into account that market conditions can affect the price received. In
        volatile markets—rapid price fluctuations—or thin liquidity, bid and ask price levels may expand and cause
        <i>slippage</i> (the price requested is not aligned with the <i>fill price</i>).
    </p>
    <p class="p-txt">Using the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) trading platform (figure A), the EUR/USD currency pair displays a
        bid/ask price of $1.10382/$1.10384. By clicking ‘Sell by Market’ (to sell the bid of $1.10382) or ‘Buy the
        Market’ (to buy the ask at $1.10384), the trader is entering the market immediately with 1 standard lot
        (Volume). Though, volatility, as highlighted above, can influence displayed bid/ask prices. </p>

    <p class="h-txt-cus">Limit Order</p>
    <p class="p-txt">A limit order is a command to buy or sell at pre-determined price levels, or better. In other
        words, it permits market participants to <i>limit</i> their instruction to a specific price received from
        their broker (a <i>limit price</i>), whether for entry or exit. Note that limit orders are sometimes
        referred to as <i>pending orders</i> as they’re pending until filled. </p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20"> &bull; A limit BUY order (buy limit order) is placed BELOW current market
        prices </p>
    <p class="p-txt pad-txt-left-20"> &bull; A limit SELL order (sell limit order) is placed ABOVE current market
        prices </p>
    <p class="p-txt">As an example, assume a trader employing technical analysis seeks a long position (a buy
        position) on GBP/USD as the market has been trending over the past month. Instead of entering at current
        market prices using a market order, the trader believes the currency pair will correct and offer a cheaper
        entry price. Opting to work with a limit buy order <i>below</i> current price to catch any retracement is an
        option in this scenario. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">As presented in figure B, the order window for pending orders shows the option of either a buy
        or sell limit order, available from the drop-down tab: ‘Type’. At what price the limit order is set is
        arranged through the ‘at price’ section, with a choice of selecting an expiration date for the chosen limit
        order parameters. </p>

    </p>
    <span>(Figure B: MetaTrader 4 Order Window)</span>
    <p class="h-txt-cus">Stop Orders</p>
    <p class="p-txt">Another form of <i>pending</i> order is the buy and sell-stop entry orders, frequently used by
        breakout traders. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">Traders use a buy-stop order to <i>buy</i> at a level above market price, and is filled when
        the ask price tests the buy-stop level. Conversely, a sell-stop order is set beneath market price and is
        triggered when the bid price tests the level. Do note these order types are market orders once filled. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">An example of the buy-stop entry order window can be seen in figure C. With similar settings to
        the limit order, the only difference is from ‘Type’: the trader selects either Buy or Sell Stop. </p>

    <p class="h-txt-cus">Protective Stop-Loss Order</p>
    <p class="p-txt">The protective stop-loss order—sometimes referred to as a money-management stop—functions as an
        instruction to liquidate a position in the event price moves unfavourably. A stop-loss order is a vital
        risk-management tool that helps prevent financial ruin. However, do keep in mind that a stop-loss order is a
        market order. Think of it as a pending market order which is activated once prices trigger the level. This
        is also the same for take-profit levels. </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; padding: 15px 0 15px 0;">

    </p>
    <span>(Figure D MetaTrader 4 Order Window)</span>
    <p class="p-txt">A protective stop-loss order allows traders and investors to predetermine risk tolerance,
        reducing the chance of large unexpected losses.</p>
    <p class="p-txt">By way of an example, say EUR/USD trades at $1.2050 and a trader enters a long position at
        current price using a market order. According to the trader’s trading strategy, a 20-pip stop is sufficient
        and he/she consequently places a protective stop-loss order under current price at $1.2030. If price reaches
        $1.2030, the position will be automatically closed. As stop-loss orders are essentially market orders once
        filled, slippage may still occur. </p>
    <p class="p-txt">A protective stop-loss order also serves as a trailing stop, a method of trailing profitable
        positions by modifying its location according to price movement. </p>
