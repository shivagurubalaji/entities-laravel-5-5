                        commodities are widely traded across the world. The prices of these commodities depend on
                        several factors including the market forces of supply and demand. Political events, natural
                        disasters, weather, economic conditions, and policies of various governments also tend to cause
                        price fluctuations with respect to commodities. This makes the commodities market highly
                        volatile, offering several attractive opportunities for traders.</p>
                    <p class="nrml-para-font">The prerequisite to being successful in commodities trading is to gain an
                        understanding of the market and the various factors impacting the price of the commodity in
                        which you wish to trade. Investment in commodities is possible through the physical purchase of
                        the items or by investing in the futures markets through a variety of methods. They include
                        buying options on commodity futures contracts, ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), shares of companies
                        that deal in commodities (commodity stocks) or trading commodities CFDs (Contracts for
                        Difference).</p>
                    <p class="nrml-para-font">In what can be a high risk asset class, those who wish to start trading
                        commodities should have a well-planned trading strategy. This should be developed after adequate
                        research and incorporate strong risk management techniques. </p>

                                and commodities have an inverse relationship. When commodity prices rise, stock prices
                                tend to fall. To offset the impact of a decline in stock prices, investors can take
                                positions in the commodities market. By adding commodities to their portfolios, traders
                                can manage risks better. Rather than purchase an array of individual commodities,
                                traders can invest in a commodity index which would include a range of commodities.</p>

                                natural disasters cause a disruption in the supply chain. In many instances, this may
                                lead to a scarcity of resources. This puts upward pressure on the price of various
                                commodities. Traders can hedge geopolitical risks by including commodities in their

                                like CFDs, traders can choose to use high leverage offered by online brokers. Leverage
                                allows traders to take big positions in their chosen securities by paying only a very
                                small part of the total trade value. Leverage offers traders the opportunity to magnify
                                their profits with a low capital investment. Just like forex, a small increase in the
                                price of the underlying commodity can return an investor a lot of money.</p>

                            traded commodity. Two major types of oil are used to benchmark global prices - Brent Crude
                            and West Texas Intermediate (WTI). </p>
                        <p class="nrml-para-font">Brent Crude is a high quality sweet and light oil with low sulphur
                            content and density. It can be easily refined into various usable products. This type of oil
                            is drilled from oil fields in the North Sea, off the shores of the UK and Norway.</p>
                        <p class="nrml-para-font">WTI Crude is even lighter than the Brent crude. This oil variant is
                            drilled mainly in the American states of Texas, Louisiana, and North Dakota. WTI has a
                            sulphur content of 0.24% versus 0.37% in Brent crude. WTI is considered ideal for production
                            of gasoline, while Brent is preferred for diesel production.</p>

                        supply of oil. If stockpiles continue to rise in the US, it indicates that supply is higher than
                        demand, exerting downwards pressure on oil prices. This is mostly due to a decline in demand due
                        to lower economic activity. On the other hand, if oil inventories continue to rise in the US, it
                        indices that demand is higher than supply, which lifts oil prices.</p>

                        investors of all types. Gold is bought not only for its lustre and sheen, but also its value as
                        a store of wealth and, in recent times, its industrial applications. Traders often fail to take
                        advantage of the wide fluctuations in gold prices because of their inability to understand the
                        gold market and the factors affecting gold prices.</p>
                    <p class="nrml-para-font">Trading in gold is possible through the purchase of physical gold from
                        bullion traders or through gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) that include the precious metals.
                        Investors can also trade gold through funds that track the movement of the commodity or purchase
                        gold CFDs. Day trading is popular for gold, where traders close their positions at the end of
                        the day.</p>
                    <p class="nrml-para-font">Gold futures are traded on COMEX in the form of standard gold futures,
                        representing 100 troy ounces of gold and a micro gold future, which represents 10 troy ounces.
                        The smallest movement of a futures contract on an exchange is $0.10 and the number of ticks the
                        price moves determines a trader’s profit or loss. The tick value for a standard contract is $10,
                        while for a micro contract it is $1. Traders also need to check the margin requirements of their
                        trading account and the same can vary among different brokers.</p>

                        interest rates. Even geopolitical events tend to have a significant impact on gold prices.
                        Central banks of several countries keep gold reserves and their buying and selling actions can
                        lead to price swings. One can even study historical trends and charts to analyse changes in gold
                        prices over the years and identify support and resistance levels to base their trading decisions
                        on.</p>
                    <p class="nrml-para-font">Make use of the educational and news resources offered by your broker when
                        trading gold. Do not ignore news like increased output levels of gold mining companies, since
                        this indicates that supply will increase, which in turn may lead to a fall in gold prices.</p>

                        to spend time monitoring the markets. The trading code for gold is XAU. Gold prices are

                        High in demand because of its lustre and wide industrial applications, silver is also considered
                        as a safe-haven investment option. Silver prices tend to be volatile, offering traders several
                        trading opportunities with intra-day swings. Silver is also bought as a hedge against inflation.
                        Silver can be bought physically in the form of bullion and coins or can be traded via futures,
                        options and CFDs. Investors can also trade in silver by investing in exchange traded funds or

                        falling prices. CFDs are widely preferred since they do not entail taking possession of the
                        precious metal, are highly leveraged and allow traders a chance to enter both long or short
                        positions based on their expectations of future price movements. Trend trading and range trading
                        are the most popular strategies for trading silver. This requires traders to identify a trend by
                        using historical charts and determine buy or sell positions. Trading in silver needs sound risk
                        management tools like stop losses and take profit, especially if you are using high leverage.

                            <p class="nrml-para-font">CFDs are leveraged products, allowing a trader to gain higher
                                exposure than the funds available in their trading account. High leverage means low
                                margin requirements and the possibility of magnifying your profits. One must remember,
                                however, that leverage can also magnify losses. Due to this, it is recommended to use
                                leverage with sound risk management techniques.</p>

                        <p class="nrml-para-font">The first step to trading commodities CFDs is to finalise the
                            commodity or commodities you wish to trade. Initially you may choose to trade in well known
                            commodities such as gold, silver and oil as they offer high levels of liquidity and minimal
                            brokerage fees.</p>

                        <p class="nrml-para-font">The next step is to identify a broker that offers CFD trading in your
                            chosen commodities. Ensure that you choose a reputable and regulated broker, as this ensures
                            the safety of your funds and transactions. When opening a brokerage account to trade
                            commodities CFDs you should consider the leverage levels offered, spreads, customer support,
                            funding options and the product range.</p>

                        <p class="nrml-para-font">Once you have opened your trading account, you need to develop a

                            analysis methods you are most comfortable using. You can choose fundamental or technical

                        <p class="nrml-para-font">Before you begin trading with real money, it is a good idea to open a

                            strategy with virtual money. A demo account simulates live trading and gives you a feel of
                            trading with real money and explore all the tools available on the trading platform. More

                        <p class="nrml-para-font">Deposit funds into your trading account, check out the market price of
                            the commodity you wish to trade, click 'buy' if you expect the price to increase or 'sell'
                            if you believe the market will fall and select your trade size. </p>

                        <p class="nrml-para-font">Do not forget to use stop losses and limit orders. They help minimise
                            losses during periods of high volatility. The quality of your trading plan and the chances
                            of its success will depend on your knowledge of the underlying commodity, the market for it
                            and the factors affecting its price movement.</p>
                        <p class="nrml-para-font">Remember, that outlining a plan is not enough, it also needs to be
                            followed. Markets can be volatile, and you need to trust your trading strategy rather than
                            making impromptu decisions. It is a good idea to backtest your trading strategy using your
                            demo account and tweak it according to your new learnings.</p>
