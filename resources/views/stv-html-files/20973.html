                    <p class="nrml-para-font">A commodity refers to a basic good that is useful in our daily lives. In
                        economic terms, a commodity refers to goods that have full or partial fungibility (meaning whose
                        individual units are interchangeable). These commodities form the basic inputs in the production
                        of other goods and services and are widely traded across the globe. The term commodity trading
                        refers to the trading of a large number of goods, such as oil, gas, precious metals, cocoa,
                        coffee, wheat, sugar and spices. </p>
                    <p class="nrml-para-font">Trading in commodities is an ancient concept that formed the basis of the
                        barter system. Over the years, commodities trading has become more organised and is carried out
                        through formal exchanges. Initially, commodity trading was restricted to agricultural products,
                        but over the years non-agricultural commodities such as metals, energy products and diamonds
                        began being traded.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="col-md-6 pad-left-40">
                <p class="nrml-para-font">The prices of these commodities are basically determined as a function of the
                    overall market along with demand and supply factors. Well-established physical commodities are
                    traded in spot and derivative markets. A major reason for trading commodities is portfolio
                    diversification. The commodities market is useful for those who trade financial instruments from
                    other financial markets like stocks and forex.</p>
                <p class="nrml-para-font">Commodities are also considered a good hedge against inflation. This is a
                    common risk management trading strategy during periods of market volatility. Inflation corrodes the
                    value of assets like money (currencies) and exerts downward pressure on stocks. However, by its very
                    definition, inflation causes a rise in the price of commodities.</p>

                            done by investors to hedge against high inflation levels or currency devaluation. Since
                            these metals have real, conveyable value and high liquidity, they are extremely popular
                            among traders. As a result, metals are considered safe-haven instruments that tend to thrive

                        Exchange (CBOE), the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. Indirect
                        exposure to these commodity markets is possible through investments in the stocks of companies

                        through a futures contract, which is a legal agreement to buy or sell a commodity at a
                        predetermined price at a specific time in the future. In this case, the buyer of a futures
                        contract agrees to buy and take possession of the underlying commodity when the contract
                        expires. Similarly, the seller of the futures contract agrees to deliver the underlying
                        commodity at the time of contract expiry. Generally, institutional investors and commercial
                        users participate in the futures markets for commodities. Speculative retail investors typically
                        access commodity exchanges via their broker.</p>
                    <p class="nrml-para-font" style="color:#fff;">Recent years have witnessed the emergence and growing
                        popularity of <a class="custom-link-for-a" target="_blank" href="/uk/commodities/"><b>commodities

                            fought over it. Today, it is also among the most widely traded commodities in the world.
                            Commonly known as crude oil, this commodity is a naturally occurring liquid fossil fuel that
                            is in high demand and known for its volatile prices. The major benchmarks used for the
                            pricing of crude oil are the US WTI (West Texas Intermediate) and the UK’s Brent. The demand
                            for crude oil is driven as much by global economic conditions as they are by speculations
                            related to trading as well as its future production and demand levels.</p>
                        <p class="nrml-para-font">Originally used to refer to the sweet light crude oil extracted from
                            the Brent Oil field in the North Sea, Brent oil now represents crude oil blends from several
                            oil fields. The current Brent blend includes crude oil produced from the Brent, Forties,
                            Oseberg, Ekofisk and Troll oil fields. This grade of oil is lighter than the WTI oil because
                            of its relatively low density and is also sweet because of its low sulphur content. Brent is
                            the leading global price benchmark for the Atlantic Basin crude oil and is used to set the
                            price of nearly two thirds of the world’s internationally traded crude oil supplies. Despite
                            being predominantly UK based, the price of Brent is expressed in US dollars. Both WTI and

                            Lighter than air, this commodity is increasingly finding favour with traders because of its

                            electricity, besides being a source of fuel for industries. The price of natural gas is

                        remain highly volatile. This is largely because of crude oil’s susceptibility to geopolitical
                        events. Since a large proportion of the world’s oil reserves are found in only select areas like
                        the Middle East, Africa and certain parts of South America, prices tend to shift a lot. Supply
                        and demand factors play an important role in the movement of oil prices.</p>

                        cartel includes Algeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria,
                        the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia (which is the cartel’s de facto leader), the United Arab
                        Emirates and Venezuela. The group controls nearly 60% of global oil supply. The OPEC’s influence
                        on oil prices, however, declined in recent years due to the expansion of the American fracking
                        industry which uses drilling to extract oil, natural gas, and geothermal energy from deep
                        underground sources. Several nations like Canada and China also contribute significantly to
                        global oil production.</p>

                                what was experienced during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic era,
                                results in reduced demand and a downturn in oil prices. Travel restrictions during the
                                pandemic-related lockdowns across the globe saw oil prices plummet to the negative
                                territory for the first time in history. Even after the gradual reopening of economies,
                                oil prices were slow to recover due to low demand and oversupply. The OPEC cartel and
                                its allies (mainly Russia) needed to cut back production and supply significantly to
                                support oil prices, resulting in a recovery to above $45 per barrel towards the end of

                                rise in oil prices, as oil becomes cheaper in other currencies. In the same vein,
                                strength in the US dollar typically precedes a fall in oil prices. Of course, this

                        Saudi Arabia. The price of this widely traded commodity is highly dependent on supply and demand
                        and even a small change in these market forces can result in significant price swings. Since

                        favour with investors and traders alike. Silver demand is driven by its industrial use,
                        jewellery and silverware and coins, as well as photography. Most of the silver produced in the
                        world comes from Mexico and Peru, while the main consumer nations of this precious metal are the
                        US, India, UK, Mexico, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Italy. </p>

                                is considered as a hedge against inflation. Since inflation erodes the value of paper
                                currency, people flock to buying precious metals like silver during periods of high

                        commodities, you will need to first choose the type of instrument in which to trade and the

                        offer precious metals, crude oil, and other commodities. Once you are clear about the type of
                        instrument and the commodity, you will need to finalise a broker. </p>

                        <p class="nrml-para-font">Always choose a regulated and registered broker for commodities
                            trading. This ensures that the broker takes the necessary steps to safeguard your interests.
                            Ensure that the broker is regulated by an esteemed regulatory body that has stringent
                            guidelines. For instance, organisations like the Australian Securities and Investment
                            Commission (ASIC) have strict rules in place to protect traders in Australia.</p>

                            While you choose such a broker, it does not mean you have to use the complete leverage
