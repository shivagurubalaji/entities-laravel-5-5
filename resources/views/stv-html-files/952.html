                        Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Unlike fiat currencies which are regulated by their
                        respective governments or central banks, cryptocurrencies are totally decentralised and largely
                        unregulated. They use blockchain technology to keep track of transactions and tend to be highly
                        volatile in nature. They are considered a high risk investment, but with volatility also comes
                        opportunity.

                        It is important to know the difference between physical investments and trading in Contracts for
                        Difference (CFDs).

                        you need a digital wallet to store your crypto holdings. An account can be opened with an
                        exchange by depositing fiat currency. There is a high level of risk associated with this type of
                        investment in cryptocurrencies as it is open to hacks and fraudulent activity from the digital
                        wallet provider.

                        through the online trading platform of a CFD broker. While the exchange option offers investors
                        a chance to purchase even the lesser-known cryptocurrencies, it does not offer any kind of tools
                        or materials that can be useful in decision making.

                    <p>In contrast, CFD trading is fast emerging as an attractive way to trade cryptocurrencies. A CFD
                        is a contract, wherein two parties agree to pay in cash any difference in price that arises due
                        to the change in value of the underlying cryptocurrency. This means that no actual purchase or
                        sale of a cryptocurrency is conducted. Instead, traders speculate on future price movements of a
                        digital currency.

                        trading platform, like MT4. The popularity of Bitcoin is reflected by the fact that it can now
                        be traded against a fiat currency. You can now trade Bitcoin against the US Dollar (BTCUSD) in
                        the same manner as trading other fiat currencies such as the Euro and US Dollar (EUR/USD).

                    <p>Once you finalise a broker, the next step is to open a trading account, by providing the
                        necessary details and documents. You can first open a <a class="custom-link-for-a"
                            href="[[!portalUrl]]demo/register/"><b>demo account</b></a> and use it to get a
                        feel of trading Bitcoin. Follow this up with a live account. A demo account is an excellent way
                        to start trading cryptocurrency CFDs, without risking actual money. The account works in the
                        same way as a real live account, except that the money used is not real. The use of MT4 is the
                        same, with access to historical data, indicators and EAs available in both demo and live
                        accounts.</p>
                    <p class="padding-15">Once you are registered with the broker, you can download the MT4 platform
                        using the link provided by your broker and log in to your account.</p>

                        do not fall below this minimum of $1,000. If it does, the broker will notify you through a

                    <p>Traders can either open their contracts on the performance of Bitcoin, relative to another
                        cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum or Litecoin, or against a fiat currency, like the Australian
                        Dollar or the US Dollar. However, you will need to monitor the events or news that could
                        influence BTC price moves or the digital currency being traded. Apart from the demand and supply
                        for a cryptocurrency, several other factors, especially a wide variety of news related to their
                        acceptance, adoption or introduction of newer products or regulatory updates, can lead to change
                        in the prices of cryptocurrencies.</p>

                    <p>The best way to trade Bitcoin CFDs on MetaTrader 4 is to use the available resources for
