                    <p class="nrml-para-font">An index is created to measure financial or economic data, like interest
                        rates, inflation, employment level or manufacturing output. In the case of financial markets, it
                        broadly refers to a portfolio of securities that represents a particular segment, subset,
                        region, or industry.
                    <p>
                    <p class="nrml-para-font">For instance, the S&P500 is a portfolio of the top 500 stocks of companies
                        trading in the American stock market. These may not be American companies per se. Several
                        European and Chinese companies have stocks trading in the US stock market and these may be
                        included in the index.

                <div>
                    <p class="nrml-para-font">Similarly, the ASX200 is a portfolio of the top 200 stocks of companies
                        trading in the Australian stock market. In the same vein, the US Aggregate Bond Index represents
                        the US bond market. Stock indices trading is considered an attractive way of participating in
                        the movements of the stock market without having to invest in and own individual stocks.</p>
                    <p class="nrml-para-font">Global indices markets are dominated by the benchmark stock indices that
                        have a significant impact on economies and are considered reliable indicators of the financial
                        health of the segment represented by them. Before you embark on indices trading, it is a good
                        idea to know what the different types of indices are, their composition, ways to trade them and
                        the platform best suited for executing trades.</p>

                            <p class="nrml-para-font" style="color:#fff;">Since each index represents a group of
                                securities, bonds, or commodities, indices trading offers an easier way to gain exposure
                                to the segment a trader is interested in rather than investing in individual stocks,
                                bonds or commodities. As most indexes relate to a broad market, a trader does not need
                                to learn about each security and all the factors that influence their price.</p>

                            <p class="nrml-para-font" style="color:#fff;">Indices cannot be manipulated. Since an index
                                comprises of not one but several stocks or assets, it is difficult for one or a handful
                                of traders to manipulate it. To influence the price of an index, a trader would need to
                                invest in each of its components.</p>

                                in an individual stock or commodity. The inclusion of several stocks or commodities in a
                                single index helps diversifying exposure, thereby reducing volatility. Even if the value
                                of one stock plummets, it cannot impact the entire index of which it is a part. Also,
                                the plummeting of one stock may be compensated by a rally in another constituent stock
                                of the same index.</p>

                                stock will be replaced by another company’s stock, having a limited impact at best on
                                the index.</p>

                            stocks accounting for more than 80% of the Australian stock market capitalisation. The index
                            is rebalanced every quarter and its value changes only when the prices of its constituent
                            stocks change. At times, the market capitalisation of a stock may change due to share
                            buybacks or stock splits. This, however, has no impact on the index, unless those events
                            cause a fluctuation in the share price. A stock’s weight in the ASX200 is determined by its

                        <p class="nrml-para-font padding-top-30">Indices trading does not involve the buying or selling
                            of an index. While traders can buy a stock or commodity, they cannot buy the index since it
                            represents several assets and has no actual physical basis. Indices trading is done via
                            derivatives like index futures, exchange traded funds and the highly popular Contracts for
                            Difference (CFDs). A CFD is a type of contract in which the trader trades the difference in
                            the price of the underlying asset over the duration of the contract. All these tools allow
                            traders to speculate on the movements of the various indices.</p>
                        <p class="nrml-para-font">Indices trading can be done by trading a single index or various
                            indices. Indices trading offers investors a chance to gain exposure to a wider market -
                            global or regional - without having to analyse the performance of individual companies.
                            Indices trading is highly liquid and involves tighter spreads.</p>
