                        fast, user-friendly, easy to access, highly secure, and loaded with features. The MetaTrader 5
                        (MT5) platform is exactly that - plus more. This multi-functional platform is ideal for trading
                        a variety of asset classes and features an array of advanced tools. It is the latest platform
                        from MetaQuotes who also designed the predecessor, namely MetaTrader 4 (MT4). </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">MT5 is a state-of-the-art trading platform that is
                        designed to suit traders of all levels. The tools available assist beginners in learning about
                        the forex market and how contracts for difference are used to trade financial instruments such
                        as currency pairs. For seasoned professionals, the platform allows for technical analysis using
                        features such as EAs that assist with deciding and executing trades.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">The layout and user interface of MT5 are similar to the
                        popular MetaTrader 4 (MT4) trading platform, which makes it easy for traders to make a seamless
                        transition. Being the latest platform, MT5 is faster and more efficient while providing a wider
                        range of trading tools. Prior to looking at the process of opening an MT5 trading account, it is
                        useful to know what you can trade on the platform and why it is so popular for trading forex.

                        basis of a predefined set of conditions. You can program an application (as script) for
                        performing any function on the MT5 platform. For instance, you can run a script to close all

                    <p class="normal-para-font">MT5 offers a plethora of technical capabilities, with more than 80
                        technical indicators, 44 analytical objects, 21 timeframes, and an unlimited number of charts.
                        It allows one-click trading, sending your trading orders directly from the chart where you have

                    <p class="normal-para-font">While MetaTrader 5 is the latest version of the platform, it is not an
                        upgrade to the highly popular MetaTrader 4 offering. Common questions that are often asked
                        include why switch from MT4 to MT5 and how to choose between these two state-of-the-art
                        platforms? </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">The interface of both is practically the same. This was a deliberate
                        ploy from MetaTrader so that traders can make a hassle-free transition. Both platforms are fast,
                        reliable, offer a range of free EAs and have multi-charting and back-testing capabilities. Here
                        is how they are different:</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">The MT4 platform was designed with a focus on forex trading, while MT5
                        is suitable for trading in forex, commodities, indices, stocks CFDs, futures, bonds, options and
                        more. MT5 is designed to cover both centralised and decentralised financial markets. While MT4
                        supports around 250 financial instruments, MT5 has more than 1,000 assets.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6 padding-left-55-for-desktop">
                <div>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">The MT5 platform provides access to more chart timeframes than MT4.
                        While the latter has 9 timeframes, MT5 has 21! There are 7 hourly charts, 11 types of minute
                        charts as well as daily, weekly, and monthly charts. </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">While MT4 has four types of pending orders - buy stop, buy limit, sell
                        stop, and sell limit, the MT5 platform has six types of pending orders with buy stop-limit and
                        sell stop-limit the two to be added. Additionally, MT5 supports partial order filling policies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">The MT5 expert advisors (EAs) are much more powerful than those offered
                        on MT4. Remote optimisation is offered on MT5, which also allows concurrent back-testing for
                        multiple pairs.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">MQL4, which is the programming language for MT4, needs multiple
                        functions to perform every trading operation, while MQL5, the programming language for MT5, is
                        much more efficient and easier to use. The language of MT5 works well in the MT4 platform, but
                        the language of MT4 is not compatible with MT5.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">While MT5 allows both hedging (on-demand / request) as well as netting,
                        MT4 permits only hedging. It is possible to transfer funds between accounts on the MT5 platform,
                        but not on the MT4 platform. MT5 displays the DOM (Depth of Market) data, which is not shown in
                        MT4. DOM data is a graphical representation of all bids and offers for a financial asset. All
                        you need to do is click on the ALT+B buttons, and you can view the depth of markets.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">The MetaTrader 5 platform comes with an integrated economic calendar, so
                        traders can view the schedules of economic data releases, the figures of the previous release,
                        and the market expectation for each. While both MT4 and MT5 have email integration, the latter
                        supports emails with attachments.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Another unique tool available on the MT5 platform is the investor
                        password. This allows someone other than the account holder to log in to an MT5 account for the
                        purpose of viewing trading activities and histories. This is a useful tool for those who are
                        seeking independent advice on their trading strategies and behaviour.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Finally, MT5 comes with technical support, which was missing in the MT4
                        platform.</p>

                        further details like your annual income, employment status and trading experience. Your broker
                        will need to complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) process, for which certain information and

                        card. When uploading your photo identification document, ensure that your photograph is visible
                        and clear. Make sure that the document has been issued by a government agency and that it
                        clearly mentions your name, date of birth and the issue date and expiry date of the document.
                    </p>

                        is less than 90 days old. Upload the complete document and make sure that it clearly mentions

                                Account</span></p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Beginners can learn the nuances of trading with a demo account
                            without worrying about real capital being involved. The demo account also serves as an ideal
                            tool for experienced traders to test new strategies or enter a new asset class. This account
                            is also useful for back-testing strategies to determine what can be improved by going ahead.
                        </p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Another critical reason for using a demo account is to develop the
                            discipline required to keep emotions in check and continue sticking to your strategy whether
                            the market begins moving in your favour or against you. Both fear and greed can be
                            devastating for a trader. </p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font">Make sure to use risk management strategies, whether you are a
                            novice or experienced trader. A few winning trades can boost confidence and make traders
                            complacent. This can lead to traders having too many open positions, not applying stop
                            losses and take profit orders with each trade, or not monitoring the news to know about
                            market moving events. It is essential to remember that there is a high level of risk
                            associated with these financial services and any risk warnings should not be ignored.</p>

                            before you begin trading on this platform, check the trading environment provided by the
                            broker, like spreads, market depth and speed of order executions. These will help you take
                            the maximum advantage of each trade and avoid risks resulting from slippage and delays in
