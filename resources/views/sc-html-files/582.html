                        Are you seeking for a stock that has consistently outperformed earnings predictions and may be
                        well-positioned to do so in its upcoming quarterly report? Discover (DFS), a Zacks Financial -
                        Consumer Loans stock, could be a strong contender. When examining the last two reports, it is
                        clear that this credit card issuer and lender has a solid track record of beating profit
                        projections. In the last two quarters, the company has outperformed projections by an average of
                        27.16 percent.
                        <br><br>
                        Discover Financial Services (DFS.xnys)Analysis For the last declared quarter, Discover came out
                        with earnings of $3.54 per share versus the Zack Consensus Estimate of $3.42 per share,
                        representing a surprise of 3.51%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post
                        earnings of $3.68 per share and it actually produced earnings of $5.55 per share, delivering a
                        surprise of 50.82%.
                        Due in part to this background, Discover's profit projections have recently improved. Indeed,
                        the <a href="[[!getCultureURL]]/share-cfds/">stock's</a> Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) is
                        positive, which is a strong signal of an earnings beat, especially when combined with the
                        stock's good Zacks Rank.
