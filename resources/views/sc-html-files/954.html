                <p class="normal-para-font">A CFD (or Contract for Difference) is a highly specialised and extremely
                    popular financial instrument. They allow you to trade price movements of various financial assets
                    without actually acquiring or owning them. The most common financial products that are traded
                    include currency pairs, metals, commodities, indices, shares and cryptocurrencies.</p>
                <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-10">Trading CFDs involves several parties. There is the investor
                    (trader) who is looking to purchase the CFD and the counterparty that is providing the asset in the
                    transaction. Depending on where the financial instrument is being traded an intermediate party such
                    as a CFD broker, investment bank or spread betting firm may be involved. The contract involves an
                    agreement by both the involved parties to exchange the difference in the value or price of the
                    underlying asset, from the time the contract is opened to the time it is closed.</p>

                <p class="normal-para-font">The immense popularity of CFD trading stems from the many advantages offered
                    by this financial instrument. There are, however, certain risks involved. As is the case with any
                    form of trading, it is important to understand the risks and make informed decisions. Before looking
                    at the benefits and risks of CFD trading, let’s first try to understand how this financial
                    instrument actually works.</p>

                <div class="padding-top-30">
                    <p class="normal-para-font">When trading CFDs, you never buy, own or sell the financial asset.
                        Instead, you enter into a contract depending on whether you expect the price of the underlying
                        financial asset to rise or fall. For example, if the price of gold is $2,000 per ounce and you
                        expect the price to rise, you may enter into a long position. Let’s say the market moves in your
                        favour and the price of gold rises to $2,010. This means you have earned $10. </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">In a traditional trading environment one would have purchased an ounce
                        of gold, waited for the price to rise and then sold the gold to make a profit. This is where the
                        clear distinction of traditional trading and CFD trading is drawn. With CFD trading, you do not
                        need to purchase the ounce of gold to profit from a rise in its value. Instead, you simply enter
                        into a contract relating to its future price. When the contract period ends, only the difference
                        between the prior price and the current price is exchanged between the two parties. In our
                        example, $10 will be credited to your trading account.</p>

                        to $1990 per ounce, $10 would be debited from your trading account. In other words, you have
                        gained exposure to one ounce of gold without having to make an initial investment of $2,000.
                        This is a simplified example and there are a few things to bear in mind with CFD trading. We

                    <p class="normal-para-font">CFDs were introduced in London in the early 1990s. They were originally
                        a type of equity swaps that were traded on margin. Since the turn of the millennium, CFD trading
                        spread through the global markets and across asset classes. Over the years, they have gained
                        immense popularity with an increased amount of CFD providers.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Here are some of the basics when it comes to trading CFDs. Their price
                        is calculated based on the movement in the price of the underlying asset between trade entry and
                        exit. Only the change in price is computed, without considering the value of the underlying
                        asset. The initial margin is then calculated by multiplying the difference between the entry and
                        exit prices by the amount of the financial instrument that is purchased.</p>

                <p class="normal-para-font">Taking the example of gold again, if you expect the price to fall, you can
                    open a CFD to go short. If the market moves in your favour and the price falls to say $1,990 per
                    ounce when your contract ends, you make a profit of $10, although the market is falling. Purchasing
                    a contract for 10 ounces would result in a profit of $100. During the initial months of the covid-19
                    outbreak, we witnessed a unique financial situation with the price of financial instruments such as
                    indices and oil severely hit. </p>
                <p class="normal-para-font">The uncertainty across global stock markets brought about an increase in
                    market risk and volatile market conditions. For retail investors volatility is considered to bring
                    about a high level of risk due to an increase in potential losses. This is not the case for
                    experienced traders who will trade CFDs using a particular trading strategy that may include having
                    a guaranteed stop-loss order.</p>
                <p class="normal-para-font">Thanks to CFD brokers and specialised trading platforms, investors can now
                    access thousands of financial instruments across global markets. One of the main attractions of CFD
                    trading through a broker is that they offer highly leveraged products. This allows traders to
                    magnify their exposure to a financial instrument without increasing their capital investment. It all
                    sounds too good to be true so let's take a closer look.</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="normal-para-white-font">With leverage, you can open a large position by committing only a
                        small percentage of the total value of the trade. Some brokers offer <a
                            class="custom-link-for-a" href="leverage/"><b>leverage as high as 30:1</b></a>. What does
                        leverage really mean? In simple words, it is like a loan that the broker offers you. Let’s say
                        you expect the EUR/USD currency pair to climb by 100 pips from 1.1898 to 1.1998. You have $1,000
                        but your CFD broker offers an account leverage of 10:1. This means you can gain exposure of
                        $10,000 for this trade despite only having an initial investment balance of $1,000. If the
                        market moves as you estimated and the pair does add 100 pips, your profit will be $100.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-white-font padding-top-10">Without leverage, you would have had to invest
                        $10,000 to profit $100 from the above scenario. This translates to a return on investment of 1%.
                        However, since you used the 10:1 leverage offered by your broker, you could make a profit of
                        $100 by investing only $1,000. This equates to a return on investment of 10%!</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-white-font padding-top-10">In regions such as the UK and Australia, some CFD
                        brokers offer leverage of 30:1. If applied to the above scenario, one could invest $1,000 and
                        gain exposure to $500,000. Again, if the market moves as you estimated and the pair adds 100
                        pips, your profit will be $5,000 and your return on investment will be 500%. That’s a great
                        opportunity! However, it comes with elevated risks. Since your exposure is significantly higher
                        with leverage, any potential losses will also be magnified if the market moves against you. This
                        means you can lose much more than what you had committed. It is always a good idea to read any
                        product disclosure statement (PDS) prior to using such a trading system.</p>

                        to Limit the Risk Associated <br>with Leverage in CFD Trading?</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-white-font padding-top-10">Risk management is one area that separates
                        successful and experienced traders apart from the rest. Here are some things to consider:</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-white-font padding-top-10">Increasing your knowledge of CFD trading can only
                        help, but there is no substitute to hands-on trading experience. Before you begin trading CFDs,
                        consider opening a demo account which allows you to use trading platforms with virtual currency.
                        Become accustomed to share trading and observe high risk financial markets in real-time before
                        proceeding to open a live account.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-white-font padding-top-10">Another way to limit risk is by placing stop loss
                        orders with each trade. This will ensure that your order closes if the market suddenly moves in
                        the opposite direction to what you had expected. Placing stop loss enables you to curb potential
                        losses if the market moves against you. </p>

                    <p class="normal-para-font">This is not a risk per se, but often traders tend to forget their impact
                        when calculating the value of a trade. There may be several costs involved with executing a

                        in time. The buy price of the asset is typically higher than its sell price. Let’s say, the
                        spread of a security is $30.50~$30.90. If you decide to go long, you buy the security at $30.90.
                        If you sell it immediately, you incur a loss of 40 cents. When the sell price reaches $30.90,
                        you break even, although the sell price has risen. It’s only when the sell price rises above
                        $30.90 that you book a profit.</p>

                        asset classes are inherently more volatile than others. Volatility is not always a bad thing for
                        traders, as it creates more attractive trading opportunities than a flat market. However, a

                                impact of volatility. This means including several different asset classes in your
                                portfolio in order to edge against any potential market movements. </p>

                            <p class="normal-para-font">Experienced traders have the benefit of knowing market
                                conditions or news that would increase volatility. For instance, the release of the NFP
                                (non-farm payrolls) report by the US Labor Department on the first Friday of every month
                                typically causes strong price movements. The global forex market tends to experience
                                higher levels of volatility on the few hours either side of the release of the report.
                                New traders may choose to close positions during this time and wait for the market to
                                settle before resuming trading.</p>

                            <p class="normal-para-font">Placing stop-loss orders for every trade ensure that a cap is

                            total value of all your open positions. Inexperienced traders should avoid having too many

                    <p class="normal-para-font">There is also the possibility that the underlying asset becomes less
                        liquid. This could be due to some unexpected news or a major event in the domestic or global
                        market. In addition, if the demand for the asset declines, the CFD may become less liquid. If
                        this were to occur you may not get the right opportunity to exit your trade at the desired
                        price.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Slippage refers to the difference between the price at which you wish to
                        exit a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. This can occur during periods of high
                        volatility or when there is low liquidity in the market. Slippage does not always mean you incur
                        a loss. It can move in a favourable direction for you. The risk is that the movement is
                        unexpected and something that the trader did not account for when making a decision.</p>

                            Limit the Risk of Low Liquidity?</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">The best indicator of liquidity is the spread, or the difference in
                            the bid and ask price. When the spread is tight you can rest assured that there is ample
                            liquidity in the security. You need to monitor the liquidity of your security in case the
                            underlying asset is not a highly traded one. An example of this is an exotic currency pair
                            such as the USD/TRY (the US dollar versus the Turkish lira) or the EUR/HUD (the euro versus
                            the Hungarian forint). The best way to avoid liquidity risk is to trade in popular financial
                            instruments and to do so with a reputed and regulated CFD broker.</p>

                    <p class="normal-para-font">There a several brokers who are not regulated by any country’s
                        authority. In such cases, there is nothing to prevent these brokers from using the money
                        deposited by clients into their trading accounts. In fact, some brokers ensure that all
                        investments by their clients go into a single bank account which is owned by the broker. This
                        means there is no difference between the broker’s own funds and its client’s investments. These
                        brokers may use client funds in any way they desire - to meet expenses, repay debts, emerge from
                        bankruptcy or even to place trades on their own. Trading with a CFD broker that segregates
                        client money is strongly recommended.</p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font">Always trade with a broker that is regulated by one of the leading
                            regulatory authorities, like the FCA (the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority), the CySEC
                            (Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission) and the ASIC (Australian Securities and
                            Investments Commission). Such regulatory authorities make it mandatory for brokers to
                            maintain segregated accounts. This means the broker holds their own funds in a banking
                            account that is completely delineated from the accounts of their clients. Brokers
                            maintaining segregated accounts cannot use their client funds for anything other than
                            enabling the respective client to trade and covering the client’s margin requirements. </p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Regulated brokers must adhere to strict compliance regulations or

                        place it. Since the financial markets tend to move fast, any delay in order execution can mean
