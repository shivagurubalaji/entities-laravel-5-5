            How do Forex Swaps Work?
        </h2>
    </div>
    <p>The swap rate (interest rates derived from the country’s central bank, such as the US Federal Reserve or Bank of
        England) is effectively the interest that’s debited or credited to a trader or investor’s account if (when) a
        trading position is left open overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overnight, according to many brokerages, is defined as beyond 5 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST). This is the
        rollover period. Consequently, a trade that opened at 3:30 pm EST on Tuesday and liquidated at 5:30 pm EST on
        Tuesday is still considered an overnight trade, despite being active for 2 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        Transactions in foreign exchange are settled on a T+2 basis (T+2 means the trade will settle 2 days after the
        transaction date). To avoid taking physical delivery of the currencies traded, trading positions are rolled to
        the next business day, as noted above. Triple swap (three-day rollover) is applied on Wednesday and is
        essentially 3 days’ worth of interest to accommodate the weekend break. Most banking institutions close over the
        weekend. Forex brokers, therefore, apply triple rollover on Wednesday because that's how it's applied by the
        banks providing liquidity to the FX market.
    </p>

            Swap Formula
        </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        A swap is an amount a trader may gain or lose because of the interest rate at the rollover period. Depending on
        the interest rate differentials, the rollover may result in swap credit or swap debit. The nation's central bank
        determines different interest rates. Major national economic events—which you can track through an economic
        calendar—can have an impact on interest rates.
    </p>
    <p>
        For independent traders, manually calculating the FX swap rate can be difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
        How to calculate the currency swap rate is a common question as swaps are illustrated in MetaTrader 4 (MT4)
        points; traders sometimes have difficulties understanding how this translates to monetary value, your account
        value.
    </p>
    <p>
        In MT4, traders can view the swap rates through the contract specification tab. Open your MT4 trading platform
        and select Market Watch, right-click the traded pair—in this case, for example, GBP/CHF—and choose
        specification. After that, locate Swap Long and Swap Short values by scrolling down.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we hold a GBP/CHF position overnight for a 1 standard lot size, we will receive 3.02 MT4 points as a credit
        to our account for the Swap Long rate. It is -11.04 for the Swap Short rate. For this example, let's assume that
        the account balance is expressed in euros. By dividing the swap points from MT4 by the current EUR/CHF exchange
        rate of 1.05498 (3.02/1.05498), we can convert the swap rate into monetary value for euros: this equals 2.86
        euros. In this instance, 2.86 euros would be credited to your account. As noted above, the Swap Short Rate is
        -11.04 for short positions. In this case, you divide -11.04 by 1.05498, which results in a debit of 10.46 euros
        from your account based on a single standard lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a universal formula across all currencies (Euro [EUR], New Zealand dollar [NZD], Swiss franc [CHF], US
        dollar [USD], and so on).

            How to Use a Forex Swap Calculator
        </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        Trader confusion over swaps is common, and that is where a calculator can come in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a reminder, swap is the interest paid at the time of rollover: the close of business. Interest is charged on
        open positions held beyond 5 pm (New York EST), either as a debit or credit, depending on the nation's overnight
        interest rate. Avoiding manual calculation is made easier by using the FP Markets <a
            href="[[!getCultureURL]]/forex-calculator" style="color:#00bdff;">swaps calculator</a>. The
        calculator displays swap rates for both long and short positions at the bottom of the box after entering the
        account currency, currency pair, and transaction size. At the end of the trading day, you can anticipate that
        this will be debited or credited to your trading account.
    </p>
    <p>
        For many Forex traders, figuring out the swap rate can be challenging, thus, it makes sense that most turn to
        online calculators. Even though online computation is quick and easy, taking time to comprehend the manual
        calculation is considered prudent.

            Foreign Exchange Market
        </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        Forex (or foreign exchange [FX]) refers to buying or selling of one currency in exchange for another. FX
        represents the most heavily traded market in the world because individuals, traders, businesses, and countries
        all engage in this domain. We can also think about it like this. When you travel and exchange US dollars for
        euros, you are trading one currency for another in the worldwide foreign exchange market. Furthermore, thanks to
        leverage (margin), it's an accessible marketplace to invest in for retail traders without considerable (upfront)
        capital.
    </p>
    <p>
        Obviously, supply and demand for a particular currency will cause it to fluctuate in value versus other
        currencies. Hence, currencies are paired against one another: currency pairs. The most common modes of trading
        in the Forex market, particularly among retail traders, are through long and short trades: short trade (sell)
        and long trade (buy). The trader essentially speculates that the currency's value (base currency) will rise or
        fall versus the quoted currency (the second listed currency in a currency pair).
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key point in the Forex market is it is also regulated, despite trading over the counter (OTC). Examples
        are the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the regulating authority in Australia, and the
        Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom. Importantly, there is no single global body governing
        the Forex market.

            <p>Education</p>
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>It is essential to educate yourself before trading Forex. Decide which type of analysis you will use: technical
        or fundamental analysis. Some traders use both. If you use the MT4 trading platform which is the most popular
        platform for Forex traders, an abundance of tools and indicators to use for technical analysis and a newsfeed if
        you choose fundamental analysis are available. Learning about risk management is also essential: at its most
        basic, this consists of how to implement protective stop-loss orders and take-profit orders.</p>
    <p>
        This should also go without saying, but you should only use disposable income to trade. Manage your money wisely
        and ensure your responsibilities are taken care of first; for example, rent, mortgage and living expenses.

    <p>Trading the currency pair that enables you to maximize the potential of your trading technique is essential for

        Here are some steps to select the right pair for your trading style:

            <p style="font-weight:800;">1. Create a watchlist:</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Place all your preferred pairs into a watchlist if you're unsure which pair to trade first. By focusing on the
        pairs you've spent time studying, you may better choose the ideal one from the shortlist of candidates by
        creating this watchlist.
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 40px; font-size:18px;">
        <li>
            <p style="font-weight:800;">2. Review news and economic data:</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        After creating a watchlist, you must evaluate the important economic reports and news information related to
        your chosen currencies. The objective is to understand the most likely course of price action from a fundamental
        standpoint.
    </p>

    <p>
        The movement of currencies is greatly influenced by important variables such as inflation, GDP (gross domestic
        product), and CPI (consumer price index). New traders are prone to make the mistake of diving headfirst into
        fundamental analysis without fully comprehending the factors that influence price movement.

    <p>You can gain a comprehensive understanding of the Forex market through technical analysis. Using technical
        analysis is considered a good approach for identifying well-placed trade entries and exits that align with a
        strategy.

        Make sure you comprehend the micro and macroeconomic issues before analyzing price charts. This makes it easier
        for you to narrow down the currency pairs on your watch list and guarantees that you only trade currency pairs
        whose technical and fundamental analyses are in sync.

    <p>
        To analyze price charts and determine the ideal price levels or key levels that direct your trade execution and
        management, you can use indicators, chart patterns, or trading theories (such as support and resistance, Elliot
        waves, Fibonacci, etc).

        The foreign exchange market is accessible 24/5. However, there are many trading sessions with various volatility
        and liquidity levels for all pairs. Major pairings, such as the EUR and USD pairs, will be volatile if you trade
        the London and New York sessions. JPY, NZD, and AUD pairs are typically more volatile than other pairs during
        the Asian session.
