                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">Perhaps the most defining thing about 2020 has been the coronavirus
                        outbreak. The pandemic affected everything, from something as far-ranging as the global economy,
                        to the way we work and communicate as individuals.</p>
                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">However, not everything can be blamed on the pandemic. The global
                        economy and the financial markets were also impacted by the trade tensions between the US and
                        China and diplomatic tensions between the UK and Europe over Brexit. All these events wreaked
                        havoc on global stock markets and saw stock prices plummet. They also led to significant and
                        continuous changes in the demand for currencies. This is due to several factors, like reductions
                        in interest rates, governmental stimulus packages, restrictions on businesses, changing trade
                        balances and unemployment. Forex trading was also impacted by trading in other markets. For
                        instance, when the stocks of a country rally, it boosts the local currency. Similarly, if the
                        commodity market experiences a surge, commodity currencies like the Canadian dollar and the
                        Australian dollar tend to rise.</p>

                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">The coronavirus outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December
                        2019. What was initially thought to be a short-term problem quickly spiralled into a global
                        pandemic. It’s not surprising that that first currency to be impacted by covid-19 was the
                        Chinese yuan. Almost immediately, the Australian dollar also came under pressure, as China is
                        Australia biggest trading partner.</p>
                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">Soon the virus spread to Southeast Asia where currencies like South
                        Korea’s won (KRW), Malaysia’s ringgit (MYR) and Thailand’s Baht (THB) started to feel the
                        pressure. In February, covid-19 had started spreading to Spain, Germany, Italy, France, and the
                        UK. The euro and pound tumbled, but the impact was not limited to these currencies. With travel
                        restrictions, businesses being forced to close offices and factories, and supply chain
                        disruptions, investors started fearing for the global economy. Such sentiments led investors to
                        prefer safe-haven assets, like the Swiss franc, US dollar and Japanese yen, all of which gained
                        during the crisis in Europe.</p>

                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">In March, the virus outbreak was termed a pandemic. The next country to
                        be hit was the US. Infections began climbing by April and, by July, the US had become the
                        hotspot. Although the US dollar (USD) is considered as the “currency of last resort”, it
                        plummeted in the face of rising infections leading to record unemployment and economic
                        contraction. The NASDAQ plunged with record amounts being wiped off the market price as stock
                        traders on Wall Street ran for cover.</p>
                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">As the events unfolded, the global financial markets become increasingly
                        volatile. Investors and traders saw numerous attractive opportunities and trading volumes grew
                        significantly. This was especially so for the forex market. The reasons why the forex market
                        witnessed a spike in trader accounts and volumes are:</p>

                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">Consider this as a beginner's guide to forex trading.</p>
                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">Most new traders begin their trading experience with the <a
                            class="custom-link-for-a" href="forex-trading/"><b>forex market</b></a>. This is because
                        they find the currency market dynamics easier to understand. Moreover, forex is the world’s
                        largest and most liquid market. It recorded an average daily volume of $6.6 trillion in 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">The forex market is also highly accessible. It is open 24/5 because it
                        covers four major market sessions based on timings - the Sydney session, the Tokyo session, the
                        London session, and the New York session. Being readily accessible, the currency market allows a
                        trader significant flexibility to determine when to trade and what strategy to follow. New
                        traders should be aware that deeper liquidity in a particular pair exists at the time when its
                        particular market is in sessions.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6 pad-left-40">
                <div>
                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">For instance, the best time to trade a currency pair involving the
                        Australian dollar (AUD) is during the Sydney session. Similarly, the British Pound (GBP) and US
                        Dollar have the highest levels of trade during their respective London and New York sessions.
                        This is even more important for those looking to conduct short term trading as doing so will
                        minimise trading costs. Holding positions for less than a day is a trading strategy commonly
                        referred to as swing trading.</p>
                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">The low commissions involved in trading forex is also an attractive
                        proposition for newcomers. Forex trading has lower costs and fees than other markets which makes
                        it a desirable option for day trading. In fact, certain brokers offer zero commission, which
                        means they don’t charge anything and make their money from the difference between the bid and
                        ask rate (known as the spread). </p>

                        increases the demand for the local currency. This increases the value of the country’s currency.
                        On the other hand, if interest rates are too high, it leads to the problem of high inflation,
                        which discourages investors as the prices of raw materials are higher. Moreover, inflation
                        erodes the value of that country’s currency.</p>

                        (nonfarm payroll) report, which gives an overview of the employment market in the world’s
                        largest economy. Investors, traders, analysts, and fund managers look out for this report, which
                        is released on the first Friday of every month at 8:30am EST. A higher-than-expected payroll
                        figure indicates more job additions in the US. This suggests a healthier economy, as people have
                        more money to spend on goods and services, leading to economic growth. On the other hand, a
                        lower-than-expected payroll figure is detrimental for the American economy.</p>

                        diplomatic relations with other countries discourages investors. This reduces demand for the

                                to every event in the economy or socio-political environment. So, in time, all factors
                                that influence a financial instrument are reflected in its price. This includes
                                fundamental factors too.</p>

                            <p class="nrmal-parag-font">Trend is your friend: Prices of financial instruments move in
                                trends and have the tendency to remain within the trend. So, once a trend has been set,
                                the price of the security will move in the same direction as the trend.</p>

                                form patterns and these patterns will be repeated. This is due to market psychology, as
                                traders and investors are likely to respond broadly in the same way to similar price
                                movements.</p>

                            of a security over a defined period of time. In the chart, the vertical axis (y-axis)
                            represents the price of the financial instrument, while the horizontal axis (x-axis)
                            represents the timeframe. As you move from the left to right, the chart shows price
                            movements in the most recent period.</p>

                            price-points and focus only on the opening or closing price. This enables them to ignore
                            intraday price swings. Between the opening and closing price, traders often give more
                            importance to the latter.</p>

                        known as the head and represents the difference between the highest price during the trading day
                        and either the open or close price, depending on which is higher. The length of the vertical
                        line below the candlestick, known as the tail, is the difference between the lowest price of the
                        trading day and either the open or close price, depending on which is lower. The length of the
                        main body of the candlestick is the difference between the open and close price.</p>

                        and filled) to represent a decline or rally in prices. If the closing price of a security is
                        higher than the open, the body is coloured green (or left hollow), while if the close is lower
                        than the open, the body is closed red (or filled). Therefore, just by looking at the colours,
                        traders can easily know whether a security has been having mostly up days or down ones.</p>
                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font padding-top-20">If the close price is higher than the open price, this is

                        uncertainties surrounding every factor, it is impossible for traders and investors to accurately
                        respond to each. Moreover, it is natural for traders to feel apprehensive when there is high
                        volatility, or a series of unfavourable news. Similarly, traders feel more excited when there is
                        a rally, or the news is overly favourable for certain financial instruments.</p>
                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">Given these, the financial market is not driven by fundamentals alone.
                        There is another element at play, known as the market sentiment. This moves the market as much
                        as any economic indicator, event, or news. </p>
                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">For instance, during the initial months of the covid-19 pandemic, the US
                        dollar appreciated versus its major rivals. This was despite the fact that the US economy was
                        threatened by skyrocketing daily infections and growing unemployment. The demand for the US
                        dollar was driven by market sentiment.</p>

                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">On the one hand, tech stocks were rallying due to the growing dependence
                        of people on tech solutions amid the shelter-in-place orders and ecommerce growth. Two
                        individual stocks, both listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that benefited were Shopify
                        and Fastly. They have emerged through the pandemic looking stronger than ever. It was an
                        unpredictable time for stock trading with fluctuations occurring across the board. This lifted
                        demand for the currency.</p>
                    <p class="nrmal-parag-font">On the other hand, investors and traders gravitated towards safe-haven
                        options like the greenback due to concerns over the impact of the pandemic on the global
                        economy. Despite fundamentals being hit and, on a downtrend, the US currency remained elevated,
                        due to the overall mood of traders and investors. Similarly, there can be situations in which an
                        overall negative mood can cause the price of a financial instrument to tumble, even with the
                        fundamentals remaining the same or even improving. Negative sentiment will have more traders
                        committing to a down position.</p>

                        important to have a basic understanding of fundamental, technical and sentiment analysis. This
                        helps you make more informed decisions. It is equally important to select the right broker,
                        since this will determine how fast your orders are executed, how much support you will get while
                        trading and the quality of tools you will use for analysis and trading.</p>

                        dynamics without risking your own funds. Demo accounts are also a great way to test trading
                        strategies. Once you have a better understanding of market analysis and trading in general, you
                        can open a live account and start trading for real.</p>
