                    <p class="normal-para-font">A commonly used term in forex trading, a pip refers to the smallest
                        variation in the price of a currency pair and is expressed in decimal points. Measured in terms
                        of the quote or underlying currency, a pip is known as the 'Percentage in Point' or 'Price
                        Interest Point'. This standardised unit for measuring change in the price of a currency pair is
                        usually set at $0.0001 for those pairs that have the US dollar as one of the constituents.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">It is also referred to as 1/100th of 1%, or 0.01%, or one basis point.
                        The basis point is the common unit of measurement for interest rates and their financial
                        percentages. The reason for having a standardised size is to help protect investors from massive
                        losses. The larger the pip movement, the higher the volatility in the price of currencies.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Although initially used to measure the change in the prices of
                        currencies, a pip is widely used to represent the change in the prices of other financial
                        instruments too. One example of this is contracts for difference (CFDs). For traders interested
                        in trading currencies or CFDs, a clear understanding of the term pip is essential to analyse the
                        movements in markets and estimating the potential profits or losses generated by a trade.</p>

                        quote is expressed to four decimal places (most other major currencies), a pip is equal to a
                        change of 0.0001.</p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font">Let’s look at an example of calculating the pip. Say, we have a
                            GBP/USD direct quote of 1.3210. This means that you will require 1.3210 US dollars to buy
                            one British pound. Now, if there is a one pip increase, which takes the quote to 1.3211, it
                            means that you will now need 1.3211 USD to buy one GBP.</p>

                        impact of a one-pip change on a transaction will also depend on the number of units being
                        purchased. When a trader buys 10,000 pounds by paying in US dollars, they will have to pay
                        10,000 x 1.3210 or $13,210.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-20  padding-top-10-for-mobile">Now, if the exchange rate of
                        this pair rises by one pip, the price to be paid for buying 10,000 GBP will be 10,000 x 1.3211
                        or $13,211. This means the pip value when the lot is 10,000 pounds is 13,211 – 13,210 = 1 US
                        dollar.

                        EUR/USD and the lot size is the standard 100,000 units. The pip value can be estimated by
                        multiplying 100,000 by the minimum pip value that the EUR/USD moves by or 0.0001. This will give
                        a pip value of $10.</p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font padding-top-20">Calculating the pip value for currency pairs that do
                            not include the US dollar can be difficult. The process can be made easier with the use of
                            an online pip value calculator which simply requires the user to input their account’s base
                            currency. The calculator then estimates the value of a pip by multiplying the size of the
                            lot by one pip, in decimal terms, and then dividing the result by the current exchange rate
                            of the quote currency.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">The calculator provides the value of a pip for the standard unit
                            size of 100,000, mini lots of 10,000 units and micro lots of 1,000 units. The calculator is
                            quite useful and allows traders to estimate potential profits or losses. Most forex brokers
                            provide a pip calculator.</p>

                        The amount of leverage offered by a broker can be as low as 1:2 or as high as 1:500, depending
                        on the size of the brokerage house, the instruments being traded and the trader’s risk profile.

                        available for trading and chooses leverage of 1:50, they can enter into positions worth up to
                        $1,000,000 in CFD trades. This amount equals 10 standard lots in forex trade, since each pip
                        movement costs $100.</p>

                            Trading</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Pip is very important for determining the cost of trading. In
                            currency trading, brokers offer to sell a currency at one price and buy it back at a lower
                            price. So, a broker expresses a currency pair in terms of the ask or buy price and the bid
                            or sell price. For example, if the ask price for the GBP/USD is 1.3421, it means that 1.3421
                            USD will be required to buy 1 GBP. If the bid price is 1.3417, it means that 1 unit of GBP
                            can be sold back to the broker for 1.3417 USD.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">The quote price (bid/ask) for this currency pair is 1.3417/1.3421.
                            Note that the ask price is always higher than the bid price, to ensure that the broker is
                            able to cover their cost of doing business. This difference between the bid and the ask
                            price is called the spread, which is 4 pips in this case.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Spreads are influenced by several factors, such as the volatility in
                            the market, the level of uncertainty and the liquidity. Important announcements by the
                            central banks or economic data releases are the most common reasons for the widening of
                            spreads. Apart from scheduled events, factors such as political turmoil or other unscheduled
                            events can also widen the spread. </p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Spreads can be wider if the market is highly volatile or the volume
                            being traded is extremely low. In short, the spread, which is expressed in terms of pips, is
                            the minimum amount that the broker will earn on the purchase or sale of a currency or the
                            minimum amount a trader will pay on buying or selling a currency, if there is no change in
                            price. While looking to open an account, traders should look to open accounts with brokers
                            offering tight spreads. Some brokers offer <a class="custom-link-for-a"

                            Potential Profits and Losses</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Tracking changes in pip value is very important for traders, since
                            it helps them determine the potential profit or loss of a trade. Traders earn profits or
                            incur losses as exchange rates vary throughout the trading session. If the bid/ask spread in
                            the above case moves from 1.3417/1.3421 to 1.3427/1.3431, which means the trader can now buy
                            at 1.3431 and sell at 1.3427, he would earn a profit of 6 pips. However, if the bid/ask
                            quote changes from 1.3417/1.3421 to 1.3419/1.3423, the trader will buy the currency at
                            1.3421 and sell it at 1.3419, which means they will incur a loss of two pips.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Although the exchange rate has risen, it has not moved enough to
                            compensate for the cost of the spread of four pips. The total cost for the trader in this
                            case comes to 6 pips, which includes the spread of 4 pips and loss of 2 pips. This
                            emphasises the importance of liquidity and costs associate with trading.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">When a trader wishes to calculate the actual amount gained or lost,
                            they can multiply the number of pips changed at the close of the trade by the base currency
                            (dollar, in this case) value of each pip. In the above example, if the currency value or the
                            USD value in pips is $10 and the currency quote changes by 10 pips from 1.3421 to 1.3431,
                            the trader would earn a profit of $10 x 10 pips in price change, which is equivalent to
                            $100.</p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font">Pips help traders manage risks and calculate the appropriate level
                            of leverage to use for trades. Traders can use stop loss orders to limit the amount they
                            lose, if the trade moves in a direction opposite to their prediction. Pips can also help
                            traders calculate the best position size to take, without being exposed to excessive risks.

                        currency pairs. However, they can also measure the change in the prices of other assets, such as
                        Contracts for Difference or CFDs. While CFD trading does not involve buying or selling the
                        actual assets, it refers to trading contracts associated with the price movements of the
                        underlying asset. A CFD trade involves a trader entering into a contract with a broker regarding
                        the future price movement of a currency pair, index, commodity or any other financial
                        instrument. </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">There is no actual purchase or sale of the underlying instrument in CFD
                        trading and the size of the payout is decided by the direction of price movement and the pips.
                        CFD trading, like forex trading, uses pips that represent the smallest change in the price of
                        the underlying asset, which also influences the price of a CFD. So, in CFD trading, the pip
                        represents the minimum amount by which the underlying asset or financial instrument needs to
                        change in value before the CFD changes its value. </p>

                <div>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">The currency used by a trader to open a trading account determines the
                        pip value. If a trader opens a US dollar denominated account, then the pip value for currency
                        pairs, with the USD as the quote or counter currency, is $10 for a standard lot, $1 for a mini
                        lot, $0.10 for a micro lot and $0.01 for a nano lot. These pip values change when the value of
                        the USD changes by a significant percentage of more than 10%. Many forex brokers allow persons
                        living outside the United States to open a US dollar denominated account.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">However, if the account is funded in USD, but the US dollar is the base
                        currency, the value of the pip is determined by dividing the normal pip value by the exchange
                        rate between the USD and the counter currency. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6 pad-left-40">
                <div>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">If the trading account is funded by a currency that is not the USD, the
                        pip value remains the same, regardless of whether the funding currency is the quote or counter
                        currency. So, for a euro or British pound denominated account, the pip value will be €10 or £10
                        for a standard lot, €1 or £1 for a mini lot and €0.10 or £0.10 for a micro lot. However, if the
                        currency used to fund the trading account is not the quote currency, the pip value is obtained
                        by dividing the fixed pip rate by the exchange rate.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Again, if the pair being traded includes the Japanese yen (JPY), say the
                        CAD/JPY, the result obtained by dividing the fixed pip rate by the exchange rate will need to be
                        multiplied by 100. This is to account for the difference in the pips position, which is the
                        second place after the decimal, in the case of the yen (instead of the fourth, in the case of
                        other currencies).</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">To conclude, a clear understanding of pips and their effect on trade
                        positions, profits and losses is important to make informed trading decisions.</p>
