                        until the 1980s that they became a prominent part of global trading. A period of financial
                        deregulation was the catalyst for a rapid gain in popularity as a financial instrument. Driven
                        by OTC interest rate derivatives, the derivatives market has ascended to become the most traded
                        financial market in the world based on daily turnover.</p>

                        between multiple parties based on the underlying value of a financial asset. The underlying
                        assets which the value is derived on include a wide range of financial instruments such as
                        currencies, shares, commodities, indices, futures contracts, options contracts, and equities.

                    <p class="normal-para-font dvt-tdg-div-para-cnt-right-align">Derivatives trading is unique as the
                        parties involved in are speculating on the future price movements of an underlying asset without
                        actually owning it. In addition, this type of trading allows traders to take both long and short
                        positions with respect to the price of an underlying asset. This is beneficial for traders,
                        businesses and even governments who may be hedging against a current position they may already
                        have.</p>

                        can enter positions by investing only the margin required. Along with speculators and
                        arbitrageurs, margin traders are considered crucial to capital markets as they provide

                                        agreed on today. The distinct feature of futures trading is that the contracts

                        derivatives work. Participants in the coffee industry often use futures to protect against
                        adverse price movements. Coffee can be purchased in a cash market (spot market) where there is a
                        physical exchange of coffee, or in the futures market.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font" style="color:#fff;">In the latter, a roaster may agree to purchase a
                        certain amount of coffee in the future at a specified price, regardless of the coffee’s market
                        rate at the time of harvest or delivery. Assuming the price of coffee is $100 today, a roaster
                        may choose to lock in a future price of $110 for a period of 5 years. The $10 margin is in many
                        instances a small price to pay to secure a future price and protect against significant
                        increases over time.</p>

                            an economy. Derivative transactions via stock exchanges and counterparties support the
                            national economy and are an organised means for companies to safeguard against price
                            volatility. They also enable large corporations to offer consumers products and services at
                            longer lasting stable prices. </p>

                        instances, traders can use leverage to take a position on a financial instrument at a fraction
                        of the cost of the underlying asset. The ratio between the amount of money in your trading
                        account and the sum you are able to trade with is known as leverage. </p>

                        For example, a trader has a leverage ratio of 100:1. This means that they only need to have 1%
                        of the total amount of the value (margin) to execute a trade. Let's assume that the value of 1
                        Crude Oil contract is $200 and a trader wished to purchase 50 contracts with a total value of
                        $10,000. Using a leverage ratio of 100:1, they would only need 1% of the total value to execute
                        the trade (1% x $10,000). As a result, a trader would be able to purchase 50 contracts of Crude
                        Oil by depositing only the $100 margin required into their trading account.

                                    profitable but it depends on the purposes of trading. With respect to arbitrage,
                                    traders look to extract a profit by exploiting tiny differences in the pricing of
                                    identical assets in two or more markets. In contrast, if derivatives are being used
                                    for hedging purposes, the aim is not to gain a profit. Instead, it is to offset a
                                    similar gain or safeguard against potential future price fluctuations.</p>

                                    trading derivatives. They can be included as part of a portfolio diversification
                                    strategy or to speculate on the price of a financial instrument. Analysis of the
                                    value of the underlying asset should be conducted, including its price movement and
                                    any economic news that may affect it.</p>

                                    derivatives and equity is in how their value is derived, and the reason why they are
                                    traded. Equity derives its value on market conditions such as supply and demand
                                    along with news related to the company, economy or other events. In contrast, the
                                    value of derivatives is affected by other financial instruments such as bonds,
                                    currencies, commodities, and equity such as shares. The main purpose of investing in
                                    equity is to make a profit while derivatives can be used as part of a hedging
                                    strategy to mitigate risk.</p>
