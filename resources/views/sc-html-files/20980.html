                    <p class="normal-para-font">Commodities are the backbone of a country’s economy and include goods
                        that form crucial inputs for several industries. Commodities can be agricultural products or
                        products that are mined or extracted, such as precious metals. They are often traded by
                        producers to ensure regular supply even in turbulent times and by investors to diversify their
                        portfolios. Another reason why commodities trading is popular is that they act as a hedge
                        against inflation. As prices rise, making products expensive, the prices for their raw materials
                        or commodities also increase. Commodity markets are often used as a strategy to offset the loss
                        in purchasing power due to inflation.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">There are a number of factors or global events that can have a direct
                        impact of the price of commodities. Price sensitivity to country-related, economic, operational
                        and even climatic factors make commodities highly volatile, thereby offering multiple trading
                        opportunities. Specialised knowledge and awareness of the various factors such as liquidity and
                        interest rates are necessary for those looking to trade commodities. </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">In this article we will talk about ways to trade commodities, where to
                        trade, when to trade and how to manage the risks involved in commodities trading using
                        investment strategies.</p>

    <p class="normal-para-font">Trading commodities began as a simple way of exchanging goods. It has since evolved and it today comparable with financial markets such as the stock market with commodities able to be traded 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. Investors have several options for trading commodities, each providing its own advantages and disadvantages. The initial step is to decide the appropriate route for your commodities trading followed by the necessary course of action. The available options are:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="padding-top-20">
    <p class="normal-para-font" style="font-size: 24px;font-weight: 600;margin-bottom:0px;">Commodity Futures:</p>
    <p class="normal-para-font">This option allows traders to enter into futures contracts that are legal agreements to buy or sell a particular commodity at a predetermined price and on a specific date in the future. This method requires the trader to allocate a significant amount of money. Futures trading is done via a futures exchange.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="padding-top-20">
    <p class="normal-para-font" style="font-size: 24px;font-weight: 600;margin-bottom:0px;">Commodity Derivatives:</p>
    <p class="normal-para-font">The most popular option to invest in commodities, derivatives offer the advantage of not having to take ownership of the physical commodity. With derivatives, you can simply speculate on the direction of the price movement of a commodity at a specific date in the future. If the price moves according to your prediction, you could earn good returns. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="padding-top-20">
    <p class="normal-para-font">Traders can enter into a derivative contract by paying only a small initial margin to get the right to buy or sell the underlying commodity at a pre-decided price and specific time in the near future. Traders also have the option to settle the contract in cash, instead of taking delivery of the commodity on maturity of the contract.</p>

    <p class="normal-para-font">Trading in commodities futures requires an investor to open an account with an established and reputable broker offering derivatives trading. Traders can then choose instruments like contracts for difference or CFDs, which not only allow them to speculate on the prices of commodities futures but also make the most of leveraged trading.</p>

    <p class="normal-para-font">The oldest way to invest and trade in commodities is to buy them physically and store them for sale later. Rather than speculation on the price of gold, this option involves the physical purchase of commodities such as gold bullion. One would then have to factor in the expense of storing the commodities and ensuring their safety. Physical purchase can be done directly between the two parties or via established exchanges.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="padding-top-30 padding-top-20-for-mobile">
    <p class="normal-para-font" style="font-size: 24px;font-weight: 600;margin-bottom:0px;">Commodity Stocks</p>
    <p class="normal-para-font">Another way to gain exposure to commodities is to invest in the stocks of companies involved in the production of a commodity. You can buy stocks of oil refining or drilling companies, those that sell seeds or mine gold. Since the stock prices of these companies follow the price of the underlying commodity, it allows traders to reap the benefits of stock as well as commodities trading. Here too, you will first need to open an account with a trusted broker to start trading.</p>

    <p class="normal-para-font">This option involves investing in funds that invest in a large portfolio of stocks of different companies that offer commodities exposure or buy futures contracts to track the price of a commodity. Again, trading is done via brokers.</p>

    <p class="normal-para-font">With this option, several investors get together to combine their funds to invest in commodities. These funds work like mutual funds but are not publicly traded.  This method may prove to be costly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="padding-top-30 padding-top-20-for-mobile">
    <p class="normal-para-font">Once you have finalised the route through which you wish to trade commodities, the next step is to choose a broker to open a trading account with. Opening an account is simple, with easy Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. Once your account is activated, you will need to deposit the specified margin amount to begin trading on the live markets.</p>

                        get multiple trading opportunities. However, to be successful at trading commodities, it is
                        vital to adopt effective trading strategies that have been tested before or are based on
                        extensive research. Successful traders research commodity markets extensively, while also
                        gaining knowledge of the factors that affect the commodity they wish to trade. They then
                        establish strategies, using a demo account to first test their efficacy before applying them to
                        the live markets.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Trading strategies are usually based on fundamental or technical
                        analysis, or a combination of the two. Fundamental analysis involves being up-to-date with
                        various events or economic announcements that can impact commodity prices. This is possible by
                        staying abreast of the latest news and using an economic calendar to follow the release of
                        important economic data that could impact prices. </p>

                        Commodity</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Since there are hundreds of commodities being traded at any point of
                        time, it is useful to first determine a niche commodity. You may wish to focus on hard
                        commodities such as gold, palladium or crude oil. Conversely, one may choose to trade soft
                        commodities such as soybeans - an agricultural commodity.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">If the decision is to trade only in crude oil, one would be able to gain
                        the knowledge and experience required to be successful in a shorter period of time. Staying up
                        to date with oil prices and important information only related to oil companies would take less
                        time than trading in a wide range of asset classes. Irrespective of the commodity chosen,
                        trading needs to be backed by adequate research, aimed at identifying the key trends that could
                        lead to price changes.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">A trader also needs to identify and study the correlation between the
                        chosen commodity and other trading instruments. For instance, gold and the US dollar have a
                        strong negative correlation, which means that when the USD strengthens, gold price weakens.</p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font">This required a high level of detailed attention as the commodity
                            market witnesses high intraday volatility. Even a small price fluctuation could offer
                            interesting trading opportunities.</p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font" style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom:0px;">3. Range Trading</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">This type of trading requires identification of the support and
                            resistance levels by studying various charts. It involves buying a commodity at the support
                            level, when prices are at the bottom of a specific range, and selling at the resistance
                            level, when prices are at the top of the range. Commodity prices are highly impacted by the
                            law of demand and supply. Higher demand pushes up prices, while increased supply may lead to
                            a price decline.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">Identifying the factors that could lead to the bottoming of prices
                            or their reaching new highs is crucial for this trading strategy. Traders need to look for
                            oversold or overbought areas on the charts, when a clear trend is not visible.</p>

                    <p class="normal-para-font">This trading strategy is used to capitalise on the short term movements
                        in commodity prices and involves a trader buying just before substantially higher prices or
                        selling just before the price declines significantly. The key to this strategy is successfully
                        identifying a breakout. This strategy is quite effective when a trend is strong and expected to
                        last for a long time but is not recommended for short-term trends.</p>

                        Trading</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">This strategy can be based on both fundamental and technical indicators.
                        Trading decisions are based on weather forecasts and their impact on production levels of a
                        commodity or other announcements that could lead to increased demand. Traders need to spend some
                        time researching and analysing the impact of an event or announcement prior to executing trades.
                        Awareness of the commodity’s origin, its consumer base and future demand are crucial for this
                        trading strategy.</p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font">This strategy aims at capitalising on minor fluctuations in prices.
                            As a result, traders need to be highly alert at all times to identify trading opportunities.
                            In this strategy, the trader enters into several trades in a single day, exiting each
                            position after very short durations. The aim is to earn small profits with each trade. Small
                            duration charts are highly useful for this strategy.</p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">A brokerage account with low trading costs is essential with this
                            strategy due to the amount of trades placed. It is also important to remember that no
                            trading strategy can guarantee success. It is useful to regularly review your strategy or
                            even combine two or more strategies to make a trading decision.</p>
