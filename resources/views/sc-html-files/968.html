                        $356.44 billion in October 16, 2020. Bitcoin alone accounted for almost $210 billion of the

                        cryptocurrency, Ethereum, had a market cap of $42 billion, while Ripple and Litecoin contributed

                        of exchange for goods and services offered by leading companies. This was a phenomenal year for
                        the cryptocurrency, as its price rose from triple figures to surpass the $1,000 mark in
                        February. If that sounds amazing, here’s what happened over the coming month was jab-dropping.
                        By mid-November that year, Bitcoin had skyrocketed to in excess of $10,000 per coin. </p>

                        (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) emerged through initial coin offerings (ICOs). None are
                        yet to deliver the same jaw-dropping surge in prices as Bitcoin, but their growth has been
                        astounding when compared to other asset classes. Ethereum (ETH) climbed from less than $3 in
                        2016 to more than $300 in 2020. Litecoin also experienced a notable rise going from around $4 in
                        2013 to surpass the $40 mark in 2020. </p>

                        attracted legitimate traders and investors from around the world, but also hackers and people
                        with malicious intentions. This is not surprising given the value of Bitcoin and the potential
                        growth offered by various cryptocurrencies. It has however increased the necessity for

                        <p class="normal-para-font">Given the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies and rapid
                            advancements in technology, new wallet designs are continuously being launched. There is not
                            one specific Bitcoin wallet but rather a wide range of wallets that can be used to store
                            cryptocurrencies. These wallets fall into one of two categories:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="padding-top: 5px;">
                        <p class="normal-para-font"><span style="margin-bottom:0px;font-weight: 600;">Hardware Devices
                                (Cold Storage):</span> These are physical wallets that look a lot like a USB drive. Your
                            crypto coins are present on these devices and you can physically store them. Such wallets
                            are commonly referred to as cold wallets or cold storage. Each hardware wallet has a unique
                            key, known as a private key. This is essentially a unique code that works like a password to
                            access the wallet. The code decrypts the lock on the wallet, allowing you to access the
                            cryptocurrency stored in them. These are considered by experts as the most secure way to
                            store Bitcoin or other crypto assets. </p>
                        <p class="normal-para-font">There are some issues with this method of securing your cryptos. You
                            run the risk of losing the wallet or the password key. If that happens, you can never gain
                            access to your precious coins. Also, some investors consider it tedious to store a digital
                            currency offline in a physical format. After all, the advantage of digitalisation is that it
                            is always accessible. Moreover, a device can get damaged or corrupted. When this happens,
                            you may need professional help to retrieve your data. This can be both expensive and very
                            stressful as there could be circumstances where some of the data is lost. There is no
                            guarantee that the person will be successful in restoring all your data.</p>

                                (Hot Wallets):</span> These are similar to cold wallets, except that they do not have a
                            physical form. They are also considered a secure way of storing your Bitcoins or other
                            digital currency. Being cloud-based, this type of wallet is accessible from your computer,
                            smartphone, or tablet. A virtual wallet lets you store your cryptocurrencies, access them
                            from anywhere and conduct transactions. Beginners often find it easiest to open a virtual
                            wallet as it can be set up quickly, is simple to understand and straightforward to use.
                            Since they also work by using a private key, online wallets can become inaccessible if you
                            lose the key. It is incredibly important to keep your private key in a safe location that
                            you will remember.</p>

                            the cryptocurrencies you own. Some exchanges follow the approach of not actually handing
                            over the cryptos to you and give you a contract (like an IOU) instead. In this case, your
                            coins are more secure. There is one risk that you face. If the exchange goes bankrupt or is
                            forced to fold, you could lose your coins. </p>

                        <p class="normal-para-font">In 2017, a cryptocurrency exchange called NiceHash got hacked, with
                            Bitcoins worth more than $60 million getting stolen. Some clients of the exchange lost their
                            entire wallets. There is practically nothing you can do when such an event occurs as law
                            enforcement agencies are generally unfamiliar with the merging space that is cryptocurrency.
                            Therefore, it is important to follow some simple steps for added security when dealing with

                            href="what-are-cfds/"><b>contract for differences</b></a>, is a derivative financial
                        instrument that is extremely simple to trade and has gained immense popularity over the past
                        decade. The price of the CFD is based on the price of the underlying asset, which could be a
                        leading cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, or Litecoin. For instance,
                        a BTC CFD will mirror trading in Bitcoins, which means price movements in BTC CFD trading will
                        be driven by price movements in actual Bitcoin trading.</p>

                    <p class="normal-para-font">There are several other advantages of trading crypto CFDs. To begin
                        with, you can gain exposure with low capital. Since you don’t need to buy Bitcoins or altcoins,
                        you can enter the exciting crypto world even if you have limited capital. Moreover, you can find

                        How to Choose a Creditable Broker <br>for Trading Crypto CFDs?</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">If you are planning to <a class="custom-link-for-a"
                            href="cryptocurrency/"><b>trade crypto CFDs</b></a>, it is highly advisable to choose a
                        regulated broker. When checking for regulated brokers, remember that there are different
                        regulatory agencies, all of which may not have the same level of requirements. The leading
                        regulatory agencies that have the most stringent investor protection are the ASIC (Australian
                        Securities and Investments Commission), the FCA (the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority) and the
                        CySEC (Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission). Regulated brokers comply with the highest
                        standards, like maintaining segregated accounts to protect their clients’ funds.</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">It’s also advisable to select a broker that is fully licensed to provide
                        financial services and ensure that the license has been provided by a strong financial watchdog.
                        For instance, a broker that holds an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL). </p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Look at the <a class="custom-link-for-a"
                            href="regulation/"><b>regulation page</b></a> on the broker’s site for more detailed
                        information and to ensure you can trust them. This is the best way to avoid the threat of scams.
                        Also, established brokers will adopt safety protocols to prevent thefts, follow best practices
                        to protect user information and have 128-bit encryption for secure trading. </p>

                        it is on a social media platform or a review site. Successful traders earning a high income
                        should be cautious as hackers have developed unique ways to target them such as online chat

                        Retrieve My Stolen Bitcoins?</p>
                    <p class="normal-para-font">Unfortunately, there is no easy way to retrieve a cryptocurrency that
                        has been stolen from a wallet. Since cryptocurrencies are based on the premise of anonymity,
                        there is practically nothing you can do if a hacker gains access to your private keys. In the
                        case of exchanges, choose one that is thorough with the KYC process. This means you can trace
                        the person who has stolen your Bitcoins, provided it is someone with an account on the exchange.
