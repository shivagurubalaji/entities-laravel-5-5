                        Risk Warning</b>
                    <br>
                    Contracts for Difference (CFDs) are leveraged over-the-counter derivative products and carry a high
                    level of risk to your capital.
                    <br>
                    You should only risk capital that you can afford to lose. In certain circumstances, due to
                    fluctuations in market value you may not get back your initial investment amount. You may not only
                    lose your initial investment but you may incur a liability to pay a further amount to cover losses.
                    This means you can lose more money than you have invested.
                    <br><br>
                    Trading in CFDs is not suitable for everyone. CFDs are only suitable for investors who fully
                    understand the risks associated with these products. You should ensure that you fully understand the
                    risks involved, and seek independent advice if necessary.
                    <br><br>
                    Further information relating to the risks associated with CFDs is contained in the Product
                    Disclosure Statement for the product you choose. You must ensure that you read and understand that
                    document prior to opening an account with us. A Product Disclosure Statement is available for
                    download from this website (here) or on request from our offices.

                    FP Markets does not guarantee any particular rate or return, the performance of any investment or
