    <p>Forex trading, also referred to as foreign exchange trading or FX trading, is a global market whereby foreign
        currencies are exchanged. Some of the most common trades include exchanging Euros for US dollars or US dollars
        for the Great British Pound, or US dollars for the Japanese Yen. It is the largest market in the world and
        depending on its direction it can affect everything from the clothes and food that you buy to the cocktail that
        you order during a vacation. A vast majority of individuals that participate in the forex market work in large
        institutions such as banks, managed investment schemes and multinational corporations.

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #000000;">1. Introduction to the
                Forex Market</h2>
            <p>Out of all the global markets, the forex market is the largest. It is not found in a central exchange and
                trades worldwide across major financial centres, such as London, Hong Kong, New York and Tokyo. The FX
                market facilitates the act of exchanging one currency for another. It could occur during an
                international commercial transaction or simply during a trip overseas and in contrast to the stock
                market, the FX market has higher liquidity.
            </p>
            <p>A simple way to understand it is through online shopping. When purchasing an overseas product online,
                often the seller needs to be paid in their foreign currency. Depending on the value of one currency
                compared to the other, the buyer will either need to pay less or more for the same product. This act of
                exchange in currency is known as foreign exchange trading, also referred to as <a
                    style="color: #00aeef;" href="forex/"> forex trading </a> or just FX
                trading. For some things like online shopping, the exchange in currency may seem insignificant. However,
                the buying and selling of currencies is a vital component of the financial markets.
            </p>
            <p>Fluctuations in currency values expose businesses to risk. The forex market provides a way to hedge that
                risk by fixing a rate at which the transaction can be completed in the future (generally achieved
                through derivatives).

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #000000;">2. A Brief Background
                of Forex</h2>
            <div><iframe class="mob-vid-align" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gcbfEujoXIQ" width="100%" height="500"
                    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
            <p>The forex market concept is believed to be introduced centuries ago by the barter system and then evolved
                through major events such as the gold standard, the Bretton Woods Monetary Conference and now internet
                trading.
            </p>
            <p>Initially individuals would trade in goods. That was difficult though because it was hard for people to
                come to an agreed value. Gold coins were eventually widely accepted but proved inconvenient due to its
                weight. So printed money was chosen to represent the value of gold. However, this was suspended due to
                the catastrophes of the World Wars; the need to print more money to fund the war and the need for
                currency stability to facilitate and encourage international trade to help countries redevelop.
            </p>
            <p>Eventually, with the advances in technology and aggressive international competition, the forex market
                has developed far beyond the barter system and much more towards a digital age and floating method.

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #000000;">3. Different Types of
                Forex Markets</h2>
            <p>Overall, there are three different forex markets. The spot forex market, the futures forex market and the
                forward forex market.
            </p>
            <p>The spot forex market, or spot FX, is the physical exchange of currencies that occurs within a short
                period or the moment the trade is settled. For instance, when someone goes to exchange a currency at the
                bank, that person conducts a currency exchange ‘on the spot’.
            </p>
            <p>The futures forex market, or currency futures, is a legally binding contract whereby parties agree to
                exchange a particular quantity of currencies, at a predetermined price, at some point in the future.
                This is attractive for corporations that import a large quantity of goods and seek to avoid costs
                (exchange rate risks) by fixing a predetermined currency rate to ensure they purchase the goods at a
                fixed price. The key difference between the spot forex market and currency futures is that with currency
                futures the underlying currency has a settlement period at a specific settlement date, sometime in the
                future.
            </p>
            <p>The spot market generally settles an exchange in two business days (T+2). Although this may appear to be
                incorrect, the spot market usually requires two business days to settle the deal from buyer to seller,
                and vice versa. Weekends and public holidays need to also be kept in consideration as they can cause
                further delays to a settlement. There are exceptions to this rule such as exchanging the US dollar
                against the Canadian Dollar which settles on the next business day.
            </p>
            <p>
                The forward forex market is like the futures forex market but is not legally binding. The futures market
                is simply a standardised forward contract. The forward market is an example of an over the counter (OTC)
                market, which is an agreement to buy something at a predetermined date at a specific price in the
                future. Unlike the futures forex market, the forward forex market does not have a daily limit on price
                fluctuations. In contrast, the futures forex market specifies a maximum daily price range to minimise
                exposure to fluctuations. With forward contracts there is also the counterparty risk that needs to be
                contended with.

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #000000;">4. Forex Trading and
                How it Works</h2>
            <p>There are different ways for someone to trade on the forex market, but they all involve the synchronised
                buying of one currency while selling another. With the rise of online trading, forex traders can now
                benefit from currency price movements by using derivatives, for instance, via <a style="color: #00aeef;"
                    href="education/cfd-trading/">CFD trading</a>.
            </p>
            <p>The foreign exchange is always traded in currency pairs (also known as forex pairs). So, a trader might
                want to compare the Great British Pound against the Japanese Yen, illustrated as GBP/JPY. The first
                currency in this example, GBP, is known as the ‘base currency’. The second currency, JPY, is known as
                the ‘counter currency’ or ‘quote currency’.
            </p>
            <p>When trading on the forex market, a trader speculates whether the base currency will rise or fall
                compared to the counter currency. So, if 1 GBP buys 135.07 JPY, a trader might speculate that the GBP
                will get stronger and eventually will be able to buy 135.15 JPY instead, as an example. This is referred
                to as ‘going long’ if a trader takes a position with the expectation of price advancing (‘going short’
                refers to a sell position). The price or rate of the second currency (the quote) reflects the value of
                the first currency (base).
            </p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #000000;">5. Forex Terms to
                Remember</h2>
            <p>The price of a currency in terms of another currency is provided through a ‘forex quote’. These quotes
                always come in currency pairs because it involves selling one currency to buy another and vice versa.
                So, a currency pair will generally quote two different prices, as shown below.
            </p>
            <div><img style="max-width: 100%; width: 100%;" src="assets/images/blogs/eurusd_buysell_v2.png" /></div>
            <p>The bid price is the price at which traders can sell a currency, and the ask price is the price that
                traders can buy a currency at.
            </p>

        <div id="section6" class=""

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #000000;">6. Pros and Cons of
                Forex Trading</h2>
            <p>Forex trading has become popular. But just like every other type of trading, it comes with its benefits
                and detriments.
            </p>
            <p>A benefit of forex trading is that it is decentralised. This helps keep the cost of trading low as the
                order goes directly to the broker. Another benefit of forex trading is that it is easy to enter and exit
                trades in most major currencies (high liquidity). Also, traders can use leverage to control large
                positions with a small percentage of their own money and since the forex market is a macroeconomic
                endeavour, trading currencies largely does not require an understanding of the nuances of micro-economic
                factors.
            </p>
            <p>However, currency rates are influenced by multiple factors, such as global politics, market attitudes
                (sentiment), technical levels, news reports and even social media. This makes the forex market very
                volatile because these influential factors are sometimes difficult to analyse to draw any reliable trade
                conclusions. Furthermore, the forex market allows for high leverage positions, which means that traders
                can buy into positions with less capital but face higher risk of currency price fluctuations in their
                accounts.
            </p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #000000;">7. Lot, Leverage,
                Margin, Spread and Pip</h2>
            <p><b>Pips &amp; Lots:</b>
                The value of a currency pair and trade size are quoted in ‘pips’ and ‘lots’. A pip expresses the change
                in value between two currencies, usually the last decimal point of a price quote. For example, if the
                currency value of EUR/USD is 1.2345 and goes up by one pip, then the new value will be 1.2346. Most
                currency pairs go up to four decimal places—a pip is simply 1/100th of a percent. Lots refers to the
                size of a trade when an order is placed on a trading platform. A 'standard lot’ (100,000 units of the
                base currency) is common in the FX space, with 'fractional' lots represented in the form of either 'mini
                lots' (10,000 units of the base currency) and 'micro lots' (1,000 units of the base currency).

            </p>
            <p><b>Spread:</b>
                This refers to the difference between the buying and selling prices. Typically, the price to buy a
                currency (the Ask) will be higher than the price to sell a currency (the Bid). The higher the volume
                traded and the higher the liquidity of the currency, the tighter the spread.
            </p>
            <p><b>Leverage &amp; Margin:</b>
                When someone is trading on the ‘margin’, they take a larger position by depositing a small sum of money
                as collateral. The rest of the sum needed is ‘borrowed’. ‘Leverage’ is the ratio between the funds
                borrowed and the deposited margin.
            </p>

                Long and Short Positions</h2>
            <p>Taking a position in the forex market has three main characteristics.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 40px; font-size:18px;">
                <li>
                    <p>The choice of currency pair</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The direction of the trade (going short or going long)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The volume being traded</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Taking a long position or a short position in the forex market simply means that a trader speculates
                that the currency will either appreciate (going long) or depreciate (going short) relative to another
                currency.

                    Currency pairs</a> are placed in groups based on the volume that they are traded in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Major pairs are the most popular traded pairs in the market and include EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY,
                USD/CHF, USD/CAD and AUD/USD.
            </p>
            <p>
                Minor pairs are less frequently traded pairs which often feature major currency currencies against each
                other, excluding the US dollar: GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP and EUR/CHF.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exotic pairs are when major currencies are placed against a small or emerging currency, such as USD/PLN

                the Forex Market</h2>
            <div><img style="max-width: 100%; width: 100%;" src="assets/images/blogs/worldmap_v1.jpg" /></div>
            <p>
                Various factors can influence a currency fluctuation, many of which investors need to be aware of. This
                makes it difficult to make an accurate prediction on each trade, but they all tie back into the supply
                and demand. Just like other assets, currencies have their value determined by the number of people
                buying the currency or how many people are exchanging their own currency.

            </p>
            <p>
                Central banks manage a country’s currency: interest rates and money supply. Since they trade over $6
                trillion in various currencies per day, the financial strategies they choose to follow will have an
                impact on the economy. For instance, when inflation is predicted to rise dangerously above a set target,
                central banks will usually increase their interest rates to limit consumer spending growth, reducing
                inflationary pressures. This usually boosts a currency when interest rates rise.

            </p>
            <p>
                Extreme weather also affects the forex market. In early 2022, severe floods and dry weather impacted
                Brazil, a global commodity powerhouse in agricultural products and metals (Tatiana Freitas, 2022). This
                caused commodity prices to increase globally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Riots and wars also hugely impact the forex market. When there is a rise in social unrest, governments
                come into disrepute. This can cause individuals and other nations to trust governments less and hence be
                discouraged from trading with them and even impose economic sanctions, all of which can devalue a
                nation’s currency.

                Strategies </h2>
            <p>
                The ability to follow a strategy with informed decisions is what separates trading from guesswork. Forex
                trading provides an excellent chance for traders to diversify their portfolio and even build a career
                around it, but they should know how to time their trades with charts and how to avoid impulsive
                behaviour with common sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some take a technical approach with charts, signals and indicators to try and identify trends in a
                currency’s exchange rate to reveal where it will go next. Others take a fundamental analysis approach
                whereby they take a macroeconomic view and base their findings on a bigger picture.

                Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Fundamental analysis involves establishing a value or target price using various economic data such as
                inflation, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and interest rates. It is an assessment of a country’s economic
                well-being and, by extension, its currency. Traders try to ascertain macroeconomics trends and speculate
                accordingly. After all, history does seem to repeat itself.

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #000000;">13. Technical Analysis
            </h2>
            <p>
                Technical analysis tries to forecast price movements via historical price action. It uses things like
                indicators and oscillators, chart patterns, moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Bollinger
                Bands. Technical analysis is exploited for both short-term and long-term investments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on a particular pattern, for example, a trader will determine certain entry and exit points. With
                this approach, a trader might not be so concerned about why the price is moving but instead be more
                focused on the actual pattern of the chart and its signals.

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #000000;">14. Charts Used in
                Forex Trading</h2>
            <p>
                There are multiple charts available to use for forex trading. One is not necessarily better than the
                other, so choosing which charting method to follow will generally depend on each person’s trading style
                and preference. The main charts used are a line chart, a bar chart or a candlestick chart. On all those
                charts the y-axis (the vertical line) shows the price and the x-axis (the horizontal line) shows the
                time periods. Technicians use these charts to analyse and speculate on the market using different
                timeframes. They can look at data within a particular day, week, month, quarter or year. Note that lower
                timeframes, such as the 5-minute charts, are also employed.
            </p>
            <p><b>Line Chart</b></p>
            <div><img style="max-width: 100%; width: 100%;" src="assets/images/blogs/eurusd_h1_v1.png" /></div>
            <p>
                The line chart provides a simple way for traders to view changes in price over time. The example above
                is a line chart that shows the intraday closing price of EUR/USD from 16 Aug 2022 to 17 Aug 2022.
            </p>
            <p><b>Bar chart </b></p>
            <div><img style="max-width: 100%; width: 100%;" src="assets/images/blogs/eur_usd_st.png" /></div>
            <p>
                A ‘bar’ in a bar chart is a vertical line as shown above that shows the open (where the bar began its
                life), high (highest traded point in the period), low (lowest point in the traded period of the bar) and
                close price (the value at which the bar closed as per the traded period).
            </p>
            <p>
                The distance between the high and the low and the size of the bar tells a story to traders. A small bar
                with a small distance between the high and low illustrates a lack of interest in the market. However a
                large bar with a wide distance between the high and low price means that there has been a lot of buying
                and selling.
            </p>
            <p><b>Candlestick chart </b></p>
            <div><img style="max-width: 100%; width: 100%;" src="assets/images/blogs/eur_usd_candles.png" /></div>
            <p>
                The Japanese candlestick chart shows the same information as a bar chart with the addition of a colour
                coded system. In the above illustration, green represents a bull market (a rise in the market) and red
                represents a bear market (a drop in the market).

            </p>
            <p>Summary:</p>
            <p><b> The open price: </b> This is the price of the first transaction within a chosen time interval.
            </p>
            <p><b> The close price: </b> This is the price after the last transaction within a chosen time interval.
            </p>
            <p><b> The high: </b> This is the largest price recorded in a specific time interval.

            </h2>
            <p>
                To start trading in the forex market, you must open an account with a trusted brokerage firm, add funds
                to that account that are available for investment purposes and then start trading.

            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, the main analysis vehicles to make informed trading decisions are technical and fundamental
                analysis. One focuses on price action, and price patterns while the other on macroeconomic trends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before setting up an account, traders need to build their knowledge in the field and then use those
                analytical tools through a trading platform to speculate based on their research and developed skills.

                brokerage firm is monitored, held accountable, and offers its clients the highest level of transparency.

                Trading and How to Manage Them</h2>
            <p>
                Forex trading is a fast-paced and unpredictable environment. This means that it carries with it a level
                of risk which demands investors, especially beginners, to be well informed. Alternatively, they will be
                trading blindly and be at the mercy of social and natural events. Some risks include:

            </p>
            <p><b> Transaction risks: </b>
                Because forex trading occurs on a 24-hour basis, there is a risk of an exchange rate changing suddenly
                before a trade has been settled. Hence, the greater the time difference between entering and settling a
                contract, the greater the transactional risk.
            </p>
            <p><b> Interest rate risks: </b>
                Interest rates greatly affect the value of a country’s currency. High-interest rates attract investments
                because a stronger currency provides higher returns. On the contrary, a low interest encourages
                investors to withdraw.
            </p>
            <p><b>Leverage risks: </b>
                Market volatility and rapid changes can cause the balance of a trading account to change very quickly.
                If there are not sufficient funds available to maintain a position due to a sudden change, there is a
                risk that the position will be closed by the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding a regulated broker that you can trust, starting with a demo account, continuously building your
                trading knowledge and using a protective stop-loss order are a few of the main ingredients that can help
                a trader manage their risk effectively. Risk tolerance also plays an important role. The more
                experienced the trader, the more comfortable they are making investments because their expertise in the
                field provides them with the necessary information to make confident decisions.

            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, when trading currency pairs, an investor needs to understand both sides of the coin. Events
                that influence the base currency is as important as knowing what events affect the counter currency.
